All people have to do is ftp to:

		ftp.cs.cmu.edu

Experience has shown that this address does not always
work.  People who have trouble with it should try:

		mulerry.srv.cs.cmu.edu

If neither of these work (they are aliases and "point" to the
same machine), people can try the ip address which is:

		128.2.206.173

Once the connection has been established, they should login
with the userid anonymous and use their real userid and host
as the password.  For example weide+@speech1.cs.cmu.edu.

Once logged in, they can find your files in:

	project/fgdata

A transcript of what such a session might look like is enclosed
below, just in case if might be useful to you.  Please let me know
if you have any other questions.
