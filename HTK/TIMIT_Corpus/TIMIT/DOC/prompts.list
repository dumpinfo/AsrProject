SI613	ONE-UPMANSHIP IS PRACTICED BY BOTH SIDES IN A TOTAL WAR 
SI614	THIS BIG FLEXIBLE VOICE WITH UNCOMMON RANGE HAS BEEN SUPERBLY DISCIPLINED

SI618	HE TALKED ABOUT UNAUTHENTIC STORYLINES TOO 
SI619	HE PRAISES MANY INDIVIDUALS GENEROUSLY 
SI620	HIS PORTRAYAL OF AN EDGY HEAD-IN-THE-CLOUDS ARTIST IS VIRTUALLY FLAWLESS 
SI621	NOT A CORNER HAS BEEN VISIBLY CUT IN THIS ONE 
SI622	THE MASTER'S HAND HAS LOST NONE OF ITS CRAFT 
SI623	HE SHOWED PUNY MEN ATTACKED BY SPLENDIDLY TYRANNICAL MACHINES

SI625	A TINY HANDFUL NEVER DID MAKE THE CONCERT 
SI626	THE WORKS ARE PRESENTED CHRONOLOGICALLY 
SI627	THE HUMOR OF THE SITUATION CAN BE IMAGINED 
SI628	IT ALL TAKES PLACE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
SI629	HIS TECHNIQUE IS AMPLE AND HIS MUSICAL IDEAS ARE PROJECTED BEAUTIFULLY 
SI630	WHAT A DISCUSSION CAN ENSUE WHEN THE TITLE OF THIS TYPE OF SONG IS IN QUESTION 
SI631	PROGRAM NOTE READS AS FOLLOWS: TAKE HANDS THIS URGENT VISAGE BECKONS US 
SI632	THE ORCHESTRA WAS OBVIOUSLY ON ITS METTLE AND IT PLAYED MOST RESPONSIVELY 
SI633	HE LIKED TO NIP EAR LOBES OF UNSUSPECTING VISITORS WITH HIS NEEDLE-SHARP TEETH 
SI634	HERE HE IS QUITE PERSUASIVELY THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF MEANNESS AND SLYNESS 
SI635	HE IS A MAN OF MAJOR TALENT BUT A MAN OF SOLITARY UNCERTAIN IMPULSES 
SI636	HE WAS ABOVE ALL A FRIEND SEEKER ALMOST PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO BE LIKED 
SI637	HE ENLISTED A STAFF OF LOYAL EXPERTS AND OF MANY ZEALOUS VOLUNTEERS 
SI638	THIS THEORY EVENTUALLY PROVED INEXACT 
SI639	THE HEAVENS REFUSED TO GIVE UP THEIR WEEPING 
SI640	BUT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING RECENTLY MIGHT BE DESCRIBED AS CREEPING MANNERISM 
SI641	CLEVER LIGHT SONGS WERE OVERLY COY TRAGIC SONGS A LITTLE TOO MELODRAMATIC 
SI642	THEIR PROPS WERE TWO STEPLADDERS A CHAIR AND A PALM FAN 
SI643	THE ARMCHAIR TRAVELER PRESERVES HIS ILLUSIONS 
SI644	ALL ARE WELL WRITTEN AND ARE OVERWRITTEN 
SI645	HE IGNORES GUIDEBOOK FACTS 
SI646	NICE EVEN IF A TRIFLE GAUDY 
SI647	BELOW IS A SPECIFIC GUIDE KEYED TO THE CALENDAR 
SI648	A SAILBOAT MAY HAVE A BONE IN HER TEETH ONE MINUTE AND LIE BECALMED THE NEXT 
SI649	IT SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF UNITY OF PURPOSE AND RESPECT FOR HEROIC LEADERSHIP 
SI650	THE FAT MAN HAS TROUBLE BUYING LIFE INSURANCE OR HAS TO PAY HIGHER PREMIUMS 
SI651	FAR MORE FREQUENTLY OVEREATING IS THE RESULT OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPULSION 
SI652	JUST WHAT IS MEANT BY SPIRIT AND BY MATTER 
SI653	SURELY THIS IS A REALITY WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE 
SI654	YET IT EXISTS AND HAS AN OBJECTIVE REALITY WHICH CAN BE EXPERIENCED AND KNOWN 
SI655	YET THE SPIRIT WHICH LIVES IN COMMUNITY IS NOT IDENTICAL WITH THE COMMUNITY 
SI656	BUT THIS STATEMENT IS COMPLETELY UNCONVINCING 
SI657	A SECOND POINT REQUIRES MORE EXTENDED COMMENT 
SI658	THE STRAIGHT LINE WOULD SYMBOLIZE ITS UNIQUENESS THE CIRCLE ITS UNIVERSALITY 
SI659	HIS HISTORY IS HIS ALONE YET EACH MAN MUST RECOGNIZE HIS OWN HISTORY IN IT

SI662	SUCH A CALM AND ASSURING PEACE CAN BE YOURS 
SI663	SATELLITES SPUTNIKS ROCKETS BALLOONS WHAT NEXT 
SI664	LOOK AT THE THINGS WE DO TO ESCAPE OUR FEARS AND TO FORGET OUR WORRIES 
SI665	MEANWHILE THE ENEMY WILL CAPITALIZE ON OUR FEARS IF HE CAN 
SI666	OUR ENEMY IS ALSO THREATENING TO DEVOUR US 
SI667	YES INDEED WE TOO CAN SEE A WARLIKE HOST OF INFIDELS ENCAMPED AGAINST US 
SI668	WE ARE ALL INVOLVED IN THEM DEEPLY INVOLVED 
SI669	LATER WE SHALL SEE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN AN EMPEROR TOOK THIS IDEA TOO LITERALLY 
SI670	NEGLECT MEANS SPIRITUAL PARALYSIS OR DEATH 
SI671	A HELPFUL LEAFLET MAY BE ENCLOSED IN THE LETTER 
SI672	NONE SHOULD ASK LESS 
SI673	PSYCHOLOGICALLY THE RECEPTION SHOULD BE THE CLIMAX FOLLOWING THE SERMON

SI675	BOTH EVENTUALITIES ARE POSSIBLE LOGICALLY BUT PRACTICALLY THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE 
SI676	THEOCRACY RECONSIDERED 
SI677	COMPARABLE TRENDS CAN BE NOTED ELSEWHERE 
SI678	SALVATION RECONSIDERED 
SI679	HE IS NOT TALKING IN THE MAIN ABOUT PROBABILITIES RISKS AND DANGER IN GENERAL 
SI680	NO POLITICAL ORDER OR ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS SO CLEARLY CONTRARY TO NATURE 
SI681	WOULD SUCH AN ACT OF REFUSAL BE USEFUL 
SI682	OFTEN THEY ARE ABLE TO GET IN ONLY BECAUSE THE AREA IS DECLINING ECONOMICALLY 
SI683	AN OCTILLION ATOMS NOW LET US SEE WHERE THIS POWER COMES FROM 
SI684	THIS IS THE ATOMIC SUN THE ATOMIC NUCLEUS 
SI685	AT ANY RATE IT SHOWS US HOW IMMATERIAL WE ARE 
SI686	OTHERS WERE EPHEMERAL 
SI687	THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT TOOK MANY FORMS 
SI688	THE DEAD SPIRITS OCCUPIED A PROMINENT PLACE IN EVERY HOPE AND IN EVERY FEAR 
SI689	MEN BELIEVED THEY COULD CONTROL NATURE BY OBEYING A MORAL CODE 
SI690	PROPRIETY WAS SYNONYMOUS WITH RITUAL OBSERVANCE THE MARK OF A TRUE GENTLEMAN 
SI691	BUT THIS ESOTERIC DOCTRINE WAS LOST IN THE SHUFFLE TO ACQUIRE SPECIAL POWERS 
SI692	WHY SAID THE TEACHER ART THOU SO LATE 
SI693	HE WHO DOES NOT LOVE ABIDES IN DEATH 
SI694	THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS AND MYSTERIOUS 
SI695	THE NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS 
SI696	SOME HAVE WALKED THROUGH PAIN AND SORROW TO BRING YOU THEIR MESSAGE OF HOPE 
SI697	BUT FROM THE START THEY HAD TWO IMPORTANT INGREDIENTS: SINCERITY AND REALISM 
SI698	THE CRISIS LATER ON WHEN DEBTS SEEMED ABOUT TO OVERWHELM ME 
SI699	YOU'RE NOT LIVING UP TO YOUR OWN PRINCIPLES SHE TOLD MY DISCOURAGED PEOPLE 
SI700	YOU'RE SO PREOCCUPIED THAT YOU'VE LET YOUR FAITH GROW DIM 
SI701	THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO ASSURE MY CONTINUED EXISTENCE 
SI702	WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE POWER OF FAITH AT WORK AMONG US 
SI703	IT WAS MUSCULAR BUT IT WASN'T SYMMETRICAL 
SI704	OH YOU'LL WOBBLE AND WEAVE QUITE A BIT AT FIRST

SI710	HOWEVER THE AIRCRAFT WHICH WE HAVE TODAY ARE TIED TO LARGE SOFT AIRFIELDS 
SI711	NUCLEAR ROCKETS CAN DESTROY AIRFIELDS WITH EASE 
SI712	OUR FIRST NECESSITY AT THE VERY OUTSET OF WAR IS POST-ATTACK RECONNAISSANCE 
SI713	WHAT TARGETS HAVE WE SUCCESSFULLY KNOCKED OUT 
SI714	OTHER INTERPRETATIONS PRESENT THE MUSIC AS AN ESSENTIALLY INTIMATE CREATION 
SI715	FOR ME IT HAS MORE OF BOTH ELEMENTS THAN THE MAJORITY OF ITS COMPETITORS 
SI716	THERE ARE CANOES IDEAL FOR FISHING IN PROTECTED WATERS OR FOR CAMPING TRIPS 
SI717	NOW HERE IS TRULY A MARVEL

SI1160	NEITHER HIS APPETITES HIS EXACERBATIONS NOR HIS DESPAIR WERE KIN TO YOURS 
SI1161	WITH EACH SONG HE GAVE VERBAL FOOTNOTES 
SI1162	TWO THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO HIS POPULARITY 
SI1163	NO MORE STARTLING CONTRAST TO A SYSTEM OF SULLEN SATELLITES COULD BE IMAGINED 
SI1164	OTHERWISE THE OUTLOOK COULD BE DARK INDEED 
SI1165	THE CONTINUING MODERNIZATION OF THESE FORCES IS A COSTLY BUT NECESSARY PROCESS 
SI1166	IN THE COURSE OF ITS INQUIRY IT TOOK TESTIMONY FROM ONLY SEVEN WITNESSES 
SI1167	WE HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE UNDER A BUSHEL 
SI1168	IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF SOPHISTICATED THOUGHT TO GET THE IMPACT OF THIS FACT 
SI1169	THEY DESPISED FOREIGNERS 
SI1170	HE HAS ALSO AN EXTRAORDINARY CONSCIENCE 
SI1171	NOR WERE HIS MANNERS BARBARIC 
SI1172	HE WAS BUSY HE SAID IN HAVING SOMEONE SUBMIT TO A MONKEY-GLAND OPERATION 
SI1173	HE BROUGHT HER SHAWLS 
SI1174	IT HAD A TINY ENVELOPE TIED TO ITS WRIST 
SI1175	DIVERSITY OF PERCEPTION YES DIVERSITY OF FACT YES 
SI1176	TO SOME EXTENT PREDISPOSITIONS ARE SHAPED BY EXPOSURE TO GROUP ENVIRONMENTS 
SI1177	IN SOME MEASURE THEY DEPEND UPON THE STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY 
SI1178	MANY SELECTIONS ARE THEMSELVES CONVINCING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS APPRAISAL 
SI1179	WHAT SHALL THESE EFFECTS BE 
SI1180	WHAT FACTORS CONDITION THE DEGREE OF REALIZATION AT VARIOUS TIMES AND PLACES 
SI1181	PROPERLY USED THE PRESENT BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT INSTRUMENT OF ENLIGHTENMENT 
SI1182	LET US DIFFERENTIATE A FEW OF THESE IDEAS 
SI1183	IT IS THE OBVERSE OF TRIVIALITY SHALLOWNESS EMOTIONAL ANAESTHESIA 
SI1184	THERE RESULTS A STUDY OF LITERATURE FREED FROM THE TYRANNY OF THE CONTEMPORARY 
SI1185	HIS TECHNIQUE IS GENUINELY MASTERFUL 
SI1186	QUESTIONS CAME TO ME FROM ALL SIDES ABOUT MY WORLD CITIZENSHIP ACTIVITIES 
SI1187	HE ADVISED IMMEDIATE HOSPITALIZATION 
SI1188	MAYBE THEY WILL TAKE US 
SI1189	EIGHT FIELD GUNS WERE CAPTURED IN POSITION 
SI1190	NEXT BEST TO DESTROYING AN ARMY IS TO DEPRIVE IT OF ITS FREEDOM OF ACTION 
SI1191	ALL CHANCE OF FULFILLING MY DESTINY IS OVER 
SI1192	SO OF COURSE HE STAYED PUT 
SI1193	HE HAD COLLARED ONE OF HIS GENERALS IN PUBLIC 
SI1194	WOE BETIDE THE INTERVIEWEE IF HE ANSWERED VAGUELY 
SI1195	PASSING DOGS WERE GREETED WITH A CORDIAL BARK 
SI1196	HE HAD ACCORDINGLY CULTIVATED ECCENTRICITY TO THE POINT OF SECOND NATURE 
SI1197	TRANSPARENT LOOK WAXY SKIN COULD WELL BE UREMIA 
SI1198	IT IS AWE-INSPIRING 
SI1199	THEY CLOSE SOMETIME AFTER EIGHT 
SI1200	LET HIM BECOME HONEST AND THEY DISCARD HIM 
SI1201	WE HOPE THAT HE WILL EXECUTE IT IN A MANNER THAT WILL ENTITLE HIM TO CREDIT 
SI1202	HIS ARTISTIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS GUARANTEED HIM ENTRY INTO ANY SOCIAL GATHERING 
SI1203	INSTEAD OF THAT HE WAS ENGULFED BY BEDLAM 
SI1204	THE PURCHASERS REJECTED THE ORDER IN TWO LETTERS WRITTEN IN VIGOROUS TERMS 
SI1205	BUT WE AREN'T GOING TO LET YOU GIVE HIM ANY 
SI1206	ALL ABOUT HIM STOOD TOMBSTONES HIS OWN SENSITIVE GREAT HANDS HAD FASHIONED 
SI1207	BUT THEY WOULD RECONSIDER IT THEY ASSURED HIM IF HE WOULD REWRITE IT 
SI1208	THIS DOCTRINE WAS REPUGNANT TO MY MORAL SENSE 
SI1209	IF DISOBEYED THE RESULT IS TURMOIL AND CHAOS 
SI1210	AS WE OBSERVE MORAL LAW AND PHYSICAL LAW THEY APPEAR AS BEING INEVITABLE 
SI1211	THEIR BASIS SEEMS DEEPER THAN MERE AUTHORITY 
SI1212	THEY ARE NOT TRUE BECAUSE SCIENTISTS OR PROPHETS SAY THEY ARE TRUE 
SI1213	MY OWN EXPERIENCE HAS FOLLOWED SIMPLER LINES 
SI1214	RELIGION THUS BECOMES INTEGRATED WITH LIFE 
SI1215	THIS TRUTH THAT THE MORAL LAW IS NATURAL HAS OTHER IMPORTANT COROLLARIES 
SI1216	LET US NOW GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO THE SOUL 
SI1217	ONLY THOSE STORY TELLERS WILL REMAIN WHO CAN IMITATE THE STYLE OF THE VIRTUOUS 
SI1218	POETS MOREOVER DWELL ON HUMAN PASSIONS 
SI1219	STUDENTS' CHOICES OF IDEAL EDUCATIONAL GOALS ARE NOT ARBITRARY OR WHIMSICAL 
SI1220	THEY ALSO WANT MONEY PRESTIGE AND SECURITY 
SI1221	CONSERVATISM AND TRADITIONALISM SEEM IMPLIED BY WHAT HAS JUST BEEN SAID 
SI1222	AVOWED ATHEISTS OR FREETHINKERS ARE SO RARE AS TO BE A CURIOSITY 
SI1223	THE REDCOATS RAN LIKE RABBITS 
SI1224	THIS IS NEVERTHELESS A MINORITY VIEW 
SI1225	THE TRAGIC STAGE IS A PLATFORM EXTENDING PRECARIOUSLY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL 
SI1226	THE WHEEL OF SOCIAL LIFE SPUN AROUND THE ROYAL OR ARISTOCRATIC CENTRE 
SI1227	FROM IT SPOKES OF ORDER AND DEGREE LED TO THE OUTWARD RIM OF THE COMMON MAN 
SI1228	TRAGEDY PRESUMES SUCH A CONFIGURATION 
SI1229	ITS SPHERE IS THAT OF ROYAL COURTS DYNASTIC QUARRELS AND VAULTING AMBITIONS 
SI1230	PRINCES AND FACTIONS CLASHED IN THE OPEN STREET AND DIED ON THE OPEN SCAFFOLD 
SI1231	AND THEIR CHRONICLERS ARE NOT THE DRAMATIC POETS BUT THE PROSE NOVELISTS 
SI1232	THEY WERE NOT YET PREPARED TO ACCEPT IT AS IRREMEDIABLE 
SI1233	IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE THAT MOST EVIDENCE POINTS TO AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION 
SI1234	BUT NONE OF THIS COULD SOOTHE THE EXACERBATED NERVES 
SI1235	WE OFTEN SAY OF A PERSON THAT HE LOOKS YOUNG FOR HIS AGE OR OLD FOR HIS AGE 
SI1236	BOY YOU AIN'T FOOLING NOBODY BUT YOURSELF 
SI1237	WE MAY SAY OF SOME UNFORTUNATES THAT THEY WERE NEVER YOUNG 
SI1238	HOW ON EARTH DO YOU MANAGE IT 
SI1239	THUS FAR THE ADVANCES MADE HAVE BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY ALONG FUNCTIONAL LINES 
SI1240	HE IS FORCED TO PLAY FOR LITTLE MONEY AND MUST OFTEN TAKE ANOTHER JOB TO LIVE 
SI1241	IN MANY OF HIS POEMS DEATH COMES BY TRAIN: A STRONGLY EVOCATIVE VISUAL IMAGE 
SI1242	BUT IT DID PRINT GOOD VERSE AND GOOD FICTION 
SI1243	IDEAS ARE THE THRUWAY TO NOWHERE 
SI1244	THE SCULPTOR LOOKED AT HIM BUGEYED AND AMAZED ANGRY 
SI1245	OBJECT A VILLAGE CROSSROADS 
SI1246	HE WAS THUS AN EARLY AND SPECTACULAR VICTIM 
SI1247	NO POETRY NO AIRPLANES NO DANCERS 
SI1248	THE TROUBLE IS THAT LIKE MANY SYMBOLS IT DOESN'T SEEM A VERY REALISTIC ONE 
SI1249	MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY 
SI1250	EVIDENCE THAT OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING ARE UNAVAILABLE MUST BE PROVIDED 
SI1251	ONLY RARELY IS ATTENTION GIVEN TO ACCURATE PROGRESS REPORTS AND EVALUATION 
SI1252	DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES A LONG-TERM APPROACH 
SI1253	MOST OF OUR AID WILL GO TO THOSE NEARING SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
SI1254	TO HONOR HIM IS TO HONOR OURSELVES 
SI1255	MY SINCERE WISH IS THAT HE CONTINUES TO ADD TO THIS RECORD HE SETS HERE TODAY 
SI1256	ORIGIN OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES 
SI1257	FORTY-SEVEN STATES ASSIGN OR PROVIDE VEHICLES FOR EMPLOYEES ON STATE BUSINESS 
SI1258	IT DOES NOT INDICATE LOOSE MANAGEMENT INEFFECTIVE CONTROLS OR POOR POLICY 
SI1259	FROM THIS MOTOR POOL PERSONNEL DEVELOP OTHER MEANINGFUL AND RELATED DATA 
SI1260	UNIT PRICES FOR STATE VEHICLES ARE INVARIABLY LOWER THAN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC 
SI1261	IN TWO CASES AIRPLANES ONLY WERE INDICATED 
SI1262	TEN OTHERS MADE NO REPLY 
SI1263	BOTH HAVE EXCELLENT INTEGRATION OF THEIR FISCAL TAX COLLECTION YEAR CALENDARS 
SI1264	DANCES ALTERNATED WITH SUNG OR SPOKEN VERSES 
SI1265	BALLETS WERE USED IN OPERA FROM ITS BEGINNING

SI1273	SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND TABLES OF AVAILABLE DATA ARE NOW IN PREPARATION 
SI1274	ATOMIC ENERGY LEVELS 
SI1275	BLOCKADE IS ONE ANSWER OFFERED BY EXPERTS 
SI1276	LAND-BASED RADAR WOULD HELP WITH THIS TASK 
SI1277	SO WOULD RADAR PICKET SHIPS 
SI1278	SOLID CONCRETE BLOCKS RELATIVELY HEAVY AND DENSE ARE USED FOR THIS SHELTER 
SI1279	BRICKS ARE AN ALTERNATIVE 
SI1280	THE SHELTER SHOWN WOULD PROVIDE ALMOST ABSOLUTE FALLOUT PROTECTION 
SI1281	THE SAME SHELTER COULD BE BUILT INTO AN EMBANKMENT OR BELOW GROUND LEVEL 
SI1282	RADIO RECEPTION IS CUT DOWN BY THE SHIELDING NECESSARY TO KEEP OUT RADIATION 
SI1283	LIVING IN A SHELTER THE RADIOACTIVITY OF FALLOUT DECAYS RAPIDLY AT FIRST 
SI1284	A BATTERY-POWERED RADIO IS ESSENTIAL 
SI1285	FAMILY RATIONING PROBABLY WILL BE NECESSARY 
SI1286	BLOWERS SHOULD BE OPERATED PERIODICALLY ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE 
SI1287	A COVERED CONTAINER SUCH AS A KITCHEN GARBAGE PAIL MIGHT DO AS A TOILET 
SI1288	A PORTABLE ELECTRIC HEATER IS ADVISABLE FOR SHELTERS IN COLD CLIMATES 
SI1289	A FLAME WOULD USE UP AIR 
SI1290	ONE OF THESE IS THE SOLIDARITY AND THE CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP OF MARRIAGE 
SI1291	THEY SHOULD LIVE IN MODEST CIRCUMSTANCES AVOIDING ALL CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION 
SI1292	OUR AIM MUST BE TO LEARN AS MUCH AS WE TEACH 
SI1293	THESE CURVES WERE DERIVED BY AN ANALYSIS OF EXTENSIVE SKYWAVE MEASUREMENT DATA 
SI1294	IF YOU ARE A LIFE TENANT YOU DEDUCT ALLOWABLE DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION 
SI1295	HE MAY GET A TAX REFUND 
SI1296	FURTHER RESEARCH WE BELIEVE WILL DEVELOP IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS 
SI1297	AT INTERVALS AN ALUMNI DIRECTORY IS ISSUED 
SI1298	BETWEEN MEETINGS HE HELPS THE PRESIDENT KEEP TRACK OF DELEGATED MATTERS 
SI1299	HOW WELL DO FACULTY MEMBERS GOVERN THEMSELVES 
SI1300	HE CAN FOR EXAMPLE PRESENT SIGNIFICANT UNIVERSITY-WIDE ISSUES TO THE SENATE 
SI1301	DEANS CAN FORM AN IMPORTANT BRIDGE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE FACULTY 
SI1302	MORE OFTEN THESE OFFICES ARE RESTRICTED TO THE GATHERING OF EMPIRICAL DATA 
SI1303	A DETAILED STUDY OF THIS LATTER PHENOMENON WAS NOT ATTEMPTED IN THIS PAPER 
SI1304	IT WAS EXPOSED TO A HIGH VELOCITY GAS JET 
SI1305	IF THEY ARE NOT ELLIPSOIDS THE CONCLUSIONS WILL BE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION 
SI1306	THIS VISCOSITY OF THE MATERIAL IN THE DROPS IS OF COURSE NOT NEGLIGIBLE 
SI1307	THIS IS KNOWN AS CONFORMATIONAL ENTROPY 
SI1308	INDEED IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEPARATE ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC FROM NUCLEAR EFFECTS 
SI1309	THE BETTER QUALITY PRODUCTS IN BOTH OF THESE LINES CONTAIN PHOSPHATE BUILDERS 
SI1310	MANY SCOURING POWDERS NOW ALSO CONTAIN PHOSPHATES 
SI1311	SOIL REDEPOSITION IS EVALUATED BY WASHING CLEAN SWATCHES WITH THE DIRTY ONES 
SI1312	IN MOST CASES THESE SOILS ARE TAKEN UP AS LIQUIDS THROUGH CAPILLARY ACTION 
SI1313	CLEANED CLOTH MUST BE PROTECTED AGAINST THE REDEPOSITION OF DISPERSED SOIL 
SI1314	THE PHOTOCHEMICAL EXCHANGE IN THE GAS PHASE 
SI1315	THERE ARE SEVERAL SOURCES OF EVIDENCE ON THE MICROMETEORITE ENVIRONMENT 
SI1316	SPACE PROBES HAVE YIELDED LITTLE INFORMATION 
SI1317	BEING BASED ON SO FEW EVENTS THESE RESULTS ARE OF DUBIOUS VALIDITY 
SI1318	TO WHAT EXTENT SUCH LOW DENSITY APPLIES TO MICROMETEORITES IS UNKNOWN 
SI1319	BIOLOGICAL WARFARE IS CONSIDERED TO BE PRIMARILY A STRATEGIC WEAPON 
SI1320	THIS AREA IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO INFECTION 
SI1321	THERE ARE OPTIMAL HUMIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIOUS AGENTS WHEN AIRBORNE 
SI1322	THIS MAY BE OF OVERRIDING IMPORTANCE IN CONSIDERING MILITARY OBJECTIVES 
SI1323	LOUSINESS IS A PREREQUISITE FOR EPIDEMIC TYPHUS 
SI1324	IT IS A HAPPY BUZZING CROWD 
SI1325	QUITE OFTEN HONEYBEES FORM A MAJORITY ON THE WILLOW CATKINS 
SI1326	THE LARVAE KEPT WARM BY THE QUEEN ARE FULL GROWN IN ABOUT TEN DAYS 
SI1327	SOMETIMES ALTHOUGH BY NO MEANS ALWAYS THESE ARE INDEED ALKALINE 
SI1328	IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE A FEW GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT THE SIX GIANTS THEMSELVES 
SI1329	THIS BIRTH LENGTH SEEMS TO BE TYPICAL 
SI1330	THE LOWER PORTION PROVIDES A RATING AT ANY STAGE BETWEEN INFANCY AND ADULTHOOD 
SI1331	NO FASCICULATIONS OR SENSORY DEFECTS WERE FOUND 
SI1332	THYROID FUNCTION TESTS YIELDED NORMAL RESULTS 
SI1333	X-RAY FILMS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN SHOWED PROGRESSION OF THE DEMINERALIZATION 
SI1334	MICROSCOPICALLY THERE WAS EMPHYSEMA FIBROSIS AND VASCULAR CONGESTION 
SI1335	INFLAMMATORY CELLS WERE STRIKINGLY ABSENT 
SI1336	THESE WERE THOUGHT TO REPRESENT REGENERATING FIBERS 
SI1337	THIS WAS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF THE BLUISH WHITE AUTOFLUORESCENCE FROM THE CELLS 
SI1338	NO ANTIGEN WAS DETECTABLE IN CERTAIN DARK SPHERICAL AREAS IN MOST CELLS 
SI1339	OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE STUDY OF THE ACTIONS OF DRUGS IN THIS RESPECT 
SI1340	THE SHOCK THERAPIES ACT LIKEWISE ON THE HYPOTHALAMIC BALANCE 
SI1341	MARKSMANSHIP EXAMPLE 
SI1342	BEFORE DERIVING THIS FORMULA WE EXPLAIN WHAT WE MEAN BY PROBLEMS OF THIS KIND 
SI1343	WE NOW GENERALIZE THESE IDEAS FOR GENERAL BINOMIAL EXPERIMENTS 
SI1344	EXPERIMENT WITHOUT A FIXED NUMBER OF TRIALS 
SI1345	TOSS A DIE UNTIL AN ACE APPEARS 
SI1346	CONSIDER COUPLES VISITING AN ART MUSEUM 
SI1347	AGAIN THE ANALYTICITY OF THE TWO CURVES GUARANTEES THAT SUCH INTERVALS EXIST 
SI1348	THE UNIVERSE IS A SAFE AND PERMANENT HOME 
SI1349	THIS EXPLAINS SOME GROUP ENDS AND PROVIDES A JUSTIFICATION OF THEIR PRIMACY 
SI1350	IT GIVES SOCIAL GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION AND MAKES FOR PROGRAMS OF SOCIAL ACTION 
SI1351	RELIGION FOSTERS GROUP LIFE IN VARIOUS WAYS 
SI1352	AS SUCH IT ACTS AS AN ANCHOR FOR THE PEOPLE 
SI1353	THESE NEEDS USUALLY CONCERN THE REDUCTION OF GUILT AND SOME RELIEF OF TENSION 
SI1354	WITHIN THE LARGER SOCIAL SYSTEM ARE THE STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL SUBSYSTEMS 
SI1355	REGULATIVE NORMS GOVERNING SUBGROUPS AND ROLES 
SI1356	THE PROBLEM OF SOLIDARITY AND MORALE AGAIN INVOLVES THE CONCEPT OF VALUES 
SI1357	THE POPULATION CAN THEREBY REPLENISH ITSELF AND ACTUALLY GROW LARGER 
SI1358	BUT THE INFORMATION ON THE DYNAMICS OF POPULATION WAS OFTEN QUITE MISLEADING 
SI1359	IN SHORT SCIENTIFIC SAMPLING WAS INTRODUCED IN PLACE OF SUBJECTIVE SAMPLING 
SI1360	IT PROVIDES A FRAME FOR THE SAMPLING CENSUS 
SI1361	BUT IN THIS ONE SECTION WE WELCOMED AUDITORS 
SI1362	AFTER THAT WE BEGAN TO GET VISITORS TO CLASS 
SI1363	SOME OF THESE SPECULATIONS MAY HAVE SOME MERIT OTHERS ARE SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS 
SI1364	BUT WITHIN THAT FRAMEWORK HE ALLOWED FOR AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE 
SI1365	OR HOW DO WE ENRICH OUR ALREADY FINE MARRIAGE 
SI1366	OUR CAMPUS UNFORTUNATELY OWNS NO FILMS 
SI1367	THE BATTERY MEDIAN GRADE-EQUIVALENT WAS USED IN DATA ANALYSIS IN THIS STUDY 
SI1368	THE BATTING AVERAGE OF ONE SUCCESS OUT OF SEVEN INCREASED TO ONE OUT OF THREE 
SI1369	HE ADMITTED HIS BEHAVIOR AND DEFENDED IT 
SI1370	WE MAY SAY THAT HIS PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED BUT THAT HE REFUSED TREATMENT 
SI1371	TO USE THESE NEW WAYS IN DAILY LIFE IS THE LAST STEP 
SI1372	ROLEPLAYING USED FOR ANALYSIS FOLLOWS THESE GENERAL STEPS LEADING TO TRAINING 
SI1373	EACH FORM REPRESENTED BY THE DICTIONARY IS LOOKED UP IN THE TEXT-FORM LIST 
SI1374	THIS LEAVES THE ORDERING OF ENTRIES VARIABLE 
SI1375	OFTEN DOMINANT STRESS SIMPLY INDICATES A CENTERING OF ATTENTION OR EMOTION 
SI1376	SOMETIMES STRONG STRESS SERVES TO FOCUS AN IMPORTANT SECONDARY RELATIONSHIP 
SI1377	AS THESE MALADIES OVERLAP SO MUST THE CURE 
SI1378	MORPHOPHONEMIC RULES MAY BE THOUGHT OF AS JOINING CERTAIN POINTS IN THE SYSTEM 
SI1379	YOU WOULD DRIVE US INTO SHAME HE DECLARED 
SI1380	THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT THE STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
SI1381	BUT BRIEFLY THE TOPPING CONFIGURATION MUST BE EXAMINED FOR ITS INFERENCES 
SI1382	THEY ARE BOTH TREND-FOLLOWING METHODS 
SI1383	HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY PROFITS COULD A MAJORITY TAKE OUT OF THE LOSSES OF A FEW 
SI1384	THERE NEED BE NO SQUEAMISHNESS ABOUT ADMITTING THIS 
SI1385	MARKETS SHOULD BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE AS CONSUMERS BECOME MORE SELECTIVE 
SI1386	IN WAGE NEGOTIATIONS THE INDUSTRY BARGAINS AS A UNIT WITH A SINGLE UNION 
SI1387	SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CHANGE 
SI1388	SUCH LEGISLATION WAS CLARIFIED AND EXTENDED FROM TIME TO TIME THEREAFTER 
SI1389	A CLEARLY RECOGNIZED EXCEPTION IS A STATUTORY MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION 
SI1390	IT IS NOT A PLEASANT OR EASY POSITION BUT ONE WE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MAINTAIN 
SI1391	HOWEVER WHEN LABOR DISPUTES ARISE ITS PROVISIONS COME CLEARLY INTO PLAY 
SI1392	ASSUME FOR EXAMPLE A SITUATION WHERE A FARM HAS A PACKING SHED AND FIELDS 
SI1393	THERE IS NO DISPUTE INVOLVING FIELDWORK 
SI1394	THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE ISSUE ARE ENORMOUS 
SI1395	THE ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL CHILD GROWS GRADUALLY IN HIS ABILITY TO WORK IN GROUPS 
SI1396	TEACHER ASSIGNMENT IN ORDER TO DESEGREGATE 
SI1397	THE PLAINTIFF IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASES 
SI1398	DO THEY MAKE CLASS-BIASED DECISIONS 
SI1399	DOES SOCIETY REALLY EXIST AS AN ENTITY OVER AND ABOVE THE AGGLOMERATION OF MEN 
SI1400	NOW THAT THIS IS AT ODDS WITH OUR MEANING MAY BE SHOWN AS FOLLOWS 
SI1401	HE HOLDS THAT GOODNESS AND BADNESS LIE IN FEELINGS OF APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL 
SI1402	WE DO NOT ARRIVE AT SPATIAL IMAGES BY MEANS OF THE SENSE OF TOUCH BY ITSELF 
SI1403	IN WHAT WAYS THEN DID THE PATIENT'S PSYCHICAL BLINDNESS MANIFEST ITSELF 
SI1404	THINKING THE EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT TO GET A CONVICTION HE LATER RELEASED HIM 
SI1405	AND THE LAW VIRTUALLY IGNORED THE SITUATION 
SI1406	RECEIVING NO ANSWER THEY SET THE FIRE 
SI1407	WITHIN A MONTH CALLS WERE UP SEVENTY PER CENT 
SI1408	YET ONE HAS TO GO BACK ONLY SOME SIXTY YEARS 
SI1409	SURELY THERE IS NOTHING NEW ABOUT COMMUNISM 
SI1410	WE WILL ACHIEVE A MORE VIVID SENSE OF WHAT IT IS BY REALIZING WHAT IT IS NOT 
SI1411	RESOLVED THAT THE ANTI-SLAVERY SENTIMENT IS BECOMING RIPE FOR RESOLUTE ACTION 
SI1412	AND THE SURFACE IS DRIVEN BACK IN ITS VERY SURFACENESS ONLY BY THIS CONTRAST 
SI1413	IN MOST DISCUSSIONS OF THIS PHENOMENON THE FIGURES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY INFLATED 
SI1414	HOW YA GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM 
SI1415	A SECOND ASSISTANT MOPPED WITH TWO SPONGES 
SI1416	NECESSARY RETOUCHING WAS PUT ON AT ONCE 
SI1417	THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON TO MISINTERPRET OR IGNORE THE INTENT OF THIS LETTER 
SI1418	PERSONAL PREDISPOSITIONS TEND TO BLUNT THE EAR AND IN TURN THE VOICE AS WELL 
SI1419	THE FAILURE TO KEEP THESE TWO USAGES DISTINCT PRESENTS HAZARDS TO THE READER 
SI1420	THIS IS NO ASSIGNMENT FOR A FRIVOLOUS GIRL SHE ASSURES HIM 
SI1421	THOUGH BRIEF IT HAS A SHARP DRAMATIC EDGE AND GREAT POIGNANCY 
SI1422	THERE ARE MANY SUCH COMPETENTLY ANONYMOUS PERFORMANCES AMONG THE EARLIER POEMS 
SI1423	ABOUT DAWN HE GOT UP TO BLOW 
SI1424	IT HAD ASSUMED THE TERRIFYING INERTIA OF INANIMATE MATTER 
SI1425	THEY WERE BOTH VERY FLUENT 
SI1426	HIS SINUOUS MELODY IS A SORT OF NAIVE TRANSCENDENCE OF ALL EXPERIENCE 
SI1427	CONFABULATION HAS COME TO DETERMINE STRUCTURE 
SI1428	INDEX WORDS AND ELECTRONIC SWITCHES MAY BE RESERVED IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS 
SI1429	WITH THE SPRING RAINS THE FLOW ROSE RAPIDLY DUE TO INFILTRATION IN OPEN SEWERS 
SI1430	AT NO TIME WERE ALGAE FOUND IN THE MIXED LIQUOR 
SI1431	THE BACTERIA FORMED TYPICAL ACTIVATED SLUDGE FLOC 
SI1432	NOW THE PROBLEM IS PRESENTED PIECEMEAL AND SOMETIMES CONTRADICTORILY 
SI1433	WHILE ONE ELEMENT IS ANNOUNCING PROGRESS ANOTHER IS DELINEATING ITS PROBLEMS 
SI1434	CONCEIVABLY THE SUBMARINE DEFENSE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED BY SUFFICIENT FORCES 
SI1435	THE WORLD IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING WHAT WAS NEW YESTERDAY IS OBSOLESCENT TODAY 
SI1436	BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE PLAN SHOULD NOT BE ORIENTED GEOGRAPHICALLY 
SI1437	A CONCURRENT EFFORT IS NEEDED TO MAKE OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA USEFUL ON THE SPOT 
SI1438	THESE ALWAYS CONTAIN METALLIC INCLUSIONS 
SI1439	SIMPLE ELONGATION HAS BEEN TREATED IN DETAIL 
SI1440	A THIRD VOLUME REMAINS TO BE PUBLISHED 
SI1441	OTHER MORPHOLOGICAL PHYSICAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTY VALUES ARE ALSO GIVEN 
SI1442	THE DATA ARE PRESENTED IN LISTS AND TABLES 
SI1443	THE COMPOUNDS ARE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO COMPOSITION INTO SEVEN CATEGORIES 
SI1444	SUBSTANCES: ALL CRYSTALLINE SUBSTANCES AND OTHER SOLID-STATE MATERIALS 
SI1445	COVERAGE OF PRIMARY LITERATURE WILL FOLLOW 
SI1446	IN EARLIER YEARS THE PRESERVATION OF FOOD WAS ESSENTIALLY RELATED TO SURVIVAL 
SI1447	MICROORGANISMS ARE OFTEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RAPID SPOILAGE OF FOODS 
SI1448	IT WILL HOWEVER INHIBIT THE SPROUTING OF POTATOES AND OTHER ROOT VEGETABLES 
SI1449	CHIEF INTEREST IN RADIOSTERILIZATION RESIDES IN THE MILITARY SERVICES 
SI1450	MEATS: THE RADIATION PROCESSING OF MEAT HAS RECEIVED EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION 
SI1451	TO DATE THE ONE MEAT SHOWING FAVORABLE RESULTS AT STERILIZATION DOSES IS PORK 
SI1452	POULTRY: RESULTS OF IRRADIATION TESTS WITH POULTRY HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL 
SI1453	URETHANE FOAM AS AN INSULATOR IS ALSO COMING IN FOR A GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION 
SI1454	ORIGINALLY THE MAIN TYPES USED WERE VARIOUS COMPOSITIONS OF POLYESTERS 
SI1455	THE SINGLE CURVE LINE REPRESENTS A SPECIFIC FORMULATION IN A TEST EXAMPLE 
SI1456	THESE AIR OR GAS BUBBLES MAKE HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL THERMAL BARRIERS 
SI1457	THE MIXING HEAD MOVES BACK AND FORTH SLOWLY ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE RECEPTACLE 
SI1458	A DOMESTIC AUTOMATIC WASHER THAT WILL GIVE EQUIVALENT RESULTS MAY BE USED 
SI1459	THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR KNITTED FABRICS 
SI1460	THE ELECTRON OPTICAL SYSTEM MAY BE EITHER A MAGNETIC OR ELECTROSTATIC ONE 
SI1461	MEASURED PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS FOR THIS EXPERIMENTAL TUBE WILL BE LISTED 
SI1462	SPACE CHARGE INFLUENCES WILL ALSO DECREASE AT INCREASED VOLTAGES 
SI1463	WE CAN HOWEVER MAXIMIZE ITS EXPECTED VALUE 
SI1464	MANUAL LEVELING REQUIRES AN APPROPRIATE DISPLAY OF THE ACCELEROMETER OUTPUTS 
SI1465	THIS PROCESS IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT SINCE GYRO DRIFTING IS TYPICALLY RANDOM 
SI1466	IN SIMPLER TERMS IT AMOUNTS TO POINTING THE PLATFORM IN THE PROPER DIRECTION 
SI1467	THE PLATFORM ACCELEROMETERS MUST BE SLIGHTLY MODIFIED FOR THIS PROCEDURE 
SI1468	A PRECISION TRANSIT IS SET UP SO THAT IT IS ALIGNED WITH RESPECT TO TRUE NORTH 
SI1469	THIS CAN BE DONE TO A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY BY EXISTING SURVEYING TECHNIQUES 
SI1470	GYROCOMPASS HEADING 
SI1471	HE LOOKED LAZY SPOILED A LITTLE QUERULOUS 
SI1472	SHE GREETED HER HUSBAND'S COLLEAGUES WITH SMILING POLITENESS OFFERING NOTHING 
SI1473	YOU DON'T EAT ENOUGH HONEY 
SI1474	HUSKY YOUNG MAN HE SAID WITH MOCK DISTASTE 
SI1475	IS HIS APPETITE IMPROVED 
SI1476	OR: DOES HE GET EXERCISE 
SI1477	IT REQUIRED AN ENERGY HE NO LONGER POSSESSED TO BE SATIRICAL ABOUT HIS FATHER 
SI1478	HE DID NOT MIND THE USELESS KINDLY QUESTIONS 
SI1479	HAVE YOU GOT ENOUGH BLANKETS 
SI1480	CLOSER STILL REGULAR BARRICADES OF BARBED WIRE HUNG ON TIMBER SUPPORTS 
SI1481	WAS IT ALL VAIN LABOR 
SI1482	IT COULD TAKE PLACE TOMORROW NIGHT OR IT MIGHT OCCUR MONTHS FROM NOW 
SI1483	GIVE ME YOUR MACHINE GUN AMMO 
SI1484	THEY ARE ALSO HONEST SEEKERS AFTER TRUTH 
SI1485	THE OTHER PATRONS WERE TAXI DRIVERS AND ART STUDENTS AND SMALL SHOPKEEPERS 
SI1486	THE FEAR OF PUNISHMENT JUST DIDN'T BOTHER HIM 
SI1487	THESE WERE HEROES NINE FEET TALL TO HIM 
SI1488	POVERTY IMPOSES A KIND OF CHASTITY ON THE AMBITIOUS 
SI1489	AT LAW SCHOOL THE SAME 
SI1490	PERHAPS IT WAS RIGHT PERHAPS IT WAS JUST 
SI1491	HE MERELY SAID ANY GOOD DECORATOR THESE DAYS CAN MAKE YOU A TASTEFUL HOME 
SI1492	THERE WAS TYPHOID AND MALARIA 
SI1493	BY THAT TIME PERHAPS SOMETHING BETTER CAN BE DONE 
SI1494	HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN 
SI1495	TWO GAS LAMPS WERE NO MORE THAN A MISLEADING GLOW 
SI1496	AFTER THAT VIOLENCE WAS EXULTANTLY EASY 
SI1497	FROM CHILDHOOD HE HAD KNOWN ALL ABOUT KNIVES 
SI1498	HE SMASHED IT IN AND TUMBLED INTO DARKNESS 
SI1499	IT WAS LIKE FINALLY GETTING INTO ONE'S OWN NIGHTMARES TO PUNISH ONE'S DREAMS 
SI1500	YET EVEN THAT EXPLOSION DID NOT MEAN MUCH 
SI1501	BEHIND HIM BILLOWED A SMALL PUNGENT CLOUD OF SMOKE 
SI1502	IT WAS NOT EXACTLY PANIC THEY GAVE WAY TO BUT THEY COULD NOT JUST SIT THERE 
SI1503	BY THE LOOK OF HIM HE WASN'T THAT FAR GONE 
SI1504	FOR A MOMENT BOY AND MOUNT HUNG IN MIDAIR 
SI1505	THE BLOW ENCOUNTERED SILKY HAIR AND HARD BONE 
SI1506	THEY WERE PURSUING HIM 
SI1507	THE WALLS BULGED THE FLOOR TREMBLED THE WINDOWPANES RATTLED 
SI1508	HE STARED AT THE FAR MORNING EXPECTING A PENDULUM TO SWING ACROSS THE HORIZON 
SI1509	HOWEVER A BOY'S LIVELY EYES MIGHT ROVE 
SI1510	A FLASH ILLUMINED THE TREES AS A CROOKED BOLT TWIGGED IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS 
SI1511	FIDDLES SCREECHED A PIANO TINKLED 
SI1512	THEY STAYED AT HOTELS AND BOARDINGHOUSES OR AT PRIVATE HOMES 
SI1513	HE CHUCKLED THE MEMORY VIVID 
SI1514	MAYBE THEY'LL STOP IT NOW ONCE FOR ALL 
SI1515	THEY'RE DOIN' IT NOW 
SI1516	THE WORD ALSO MADE HIM FEEL HATE SINCERE HATE FOR THOSE SO LABELED 
SI1517	HIRED HARD LACKEYS OF THE WARMONGERING CAPITALISTS 
SI1518	HIS ARM MOVED SWIFTLY VIOLENTLY ONCE TWICE 
SI1519	THE THOUGHT CAME BACK THE ONE NAGGING AT HIM THESE PAST FOUR DAYS 
SI1520	SOMEBODY'LL HAFTA START THINKIN 
SI1521	HE LOOKED OVER AT HIM LYING THERE ASLEEP AND HE FELT A WAVE OF REVULSION

SI1536	DRUNKENNESS WAS NO LONGER TOLERATED 
SI1537	IT WOULD BE WELL TO SHOW THE POPULACE HOW WE DEAL WITH ADULTERERS 
SI1538	A CARRIAGE CRUNCHED BY ITS DIM LIGHTS FILTERING THROUGH THE GLOOM 
SI1539	FISTS PUMMELED HIM AS HE STAGGERED FORWARD 
SI1540	HE WONDERED IF IT WORE THE OLD ANXIETY OR THE OLD TAUT STOICISM 
SI1541	IT GAVE THE RUBBERIZED FABRIC A DULL GLEAM LIKE METAL 
SI1542	THE FEET WORE ARMY SHOES IN OBVIOUS DISREPAIR 
SI1543	THEN HE THEN WHAT 
SI1544	HE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND 
SI1545	THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO THEY WERE OR KNOW THEIR OWN WORTH 
SI1546	IN THE PITY FOR THEM HIS LONELINESS WAS GONE 
SI1547	IT IS THE SAME OLE SAME TELL ME ITS NAME

SI1553	HOWEVER THE LITTER REMAINED AUGMENTED BY SEVERAL DOZEN LUNCHROOM SUPPERS 
SI1554	THEY OFFERED NO OPINIONS VOLUNTEERED NOTHING BETRAYED NO EMOTIONS 
SI1555	A SLEEPY VOICE ANSWERED 
SI1556	HE WAITED UNTIL THEY WERE INSIDE THE ELEVATOR AND THEN SAID: NOW WHAT DO WE DO 
SI1557	THEY HAD VERMOUTH SITTING IN FRONT OF A CAFE 
SI1558	HE REACHED OUT AND FELT THE BATH TOWEL HANGING ON THE TOWEL RACK OVER THE TUB 
SI1559	VISUALLY THESE APPROXIMATED WHAT HE WAS FEELING WITHIN HIMSELF 
SI1560	LEAVE ME YOUR ADDRESS 
SI1561	THE SURGEON CARRIED A CAGE OF LIVE PIGEONS 
SI1562	WAS IT A BIRTHDAY BALL 
SI1563	IT WAS A GROTESQUE HEN FIVE OR SIX FEET TALL 
SI1564	HUSBANDRY WAS BOUNDED BY SNAKE-RAIL FENCES AND THERE WERE GRAZING CATTLE 
SI1565	THEY OFTEN THREW TIDBITS OVERBOARD 
SI1566	ONE HAD TO BELIEVE IN FINAL EVENTS OR ONE WAS STRANDED IN THE ABYSS OF NOTHING 
SI1567	HE DROVE SENSUAL PATTERNS OFF CAREFULLY SHAVING HIS LONG UPPER LIP 
SI1568	HE BEGAN TO PACK THE SADDLEBAGS 
SI1569	THIS IS OUR SINGULAR GOAL 
SI1570	ANDREI'S SKILLED EYE SIZED THEM UP 
SI1571	ICE BATHS ELECTRIC SHOCKS LASHINGS WILD DOGS TESTICLE CRUSHERS 
SI1572	HE FOUND AN EMPTY BENCH OPENED A NEWSPAPER AND STRETCHED HIS LEGS BEFORE HIM 
SI1573	HIS CAPTAIN WAS THIN AND HAGGARD AND HIS BEAUTIFUL BOOTS WERE WORN AND SHABBY 
SI1574	FLIES SWARMED AROUND THE BOWL OF LENTILS IN WHICH HE MOPPED THICK BLACK BREAD 
SI1575	SUDDENLY SHE WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS AND DRAMATIC 
SI1576	WE BOTH HAD HANGOVERS 
SI1577	BROWN EYES EYEBROW MUSTACHE 
SI1578	OVAL FACE WITHOUT AN EXPRESSION IN THE WORLD 
SI1579	EXBOYFRIEND MEET EXHUSBAND 
SI1580	HE ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE MONEY IN HIS POCKET 
SI1581	HOW ABOUT ME TRYING TO HELP HER GET HER JOB BACK 
SI1582	THEY WEREN'T AS WELL PAID AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
SI1583	FOR ONCE RADICALISM WAS A RECOMMENDATION 
SI1584	RECTOR WAS OFTEN CURIOUS OFTEN TEMPTED TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT HE NEVER DID 
SI1585	HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE PRESENT TODAY

SI1590	WITH HIS CLUB FOOT HE MIGHT WELL BE GRATEFUL 
SI1591	HER LIPS MOIST AND PARTED SPOKE HIS NAME 
SI1592	SHE SPRANG UP AND WENT SWIFTLY TO THE BEDROOM 
SI1593	NEITHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE GIFT 
SI1594	ON ALL SIDES DOORS WERE BEING SLAMMED IN HIS FACE 
SI1595	A CRUDE LADDER RAN DOWN TO A WOODEN FLOOR 
SI1596	PROMPTED BY A GUILTY URGE HE HAD DISOBEYED THE ORDER OF A MAN HE RESPECTED 
SI1597	THE FIGURE IN THE CORNER BELCHED LOUDLY A DEEP LIQUID ERUPTION 
SI1598	THE FLAT-BOTTOMED BOAT SWUNG SLOWLY TO THE PULL OF THE CURRENT 
SI1599	THEY MOVED TOWARD THE SKIFFS WITH SHOCKING EAGERNESS ELBOWING AND SHOVING 
SI1600	THE THIRD CRAWLING MAN FORCED HIMSELF ERECT 
SI1601	TWO CLOTTED BALLS THE COLOR OF MUCUS ROLLED BETWEEN FIERY LIDS 
SI1602	HIS SWEET WHISPER CAME AFTER GREAT EFFORT 
SI1603	INTELLIGENCE JABBED AT HIM ACCUSINGLY

SI1605	NOBODY DOES BUT THEY GAVE ME TEN LAST YEAR 
SI1606	INFECTIOUS HEPATITIS HE SHOUTED HEARTILY 
SI1607	HE TRAVELLED ALL OVER THE WORLD

SI1635	WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO THINK ABOUT THAT 
SI1636	THIS COAT LOOKS LIKE A RAG HEAP 
SI1637	IN A WEEK THE HYACINTHS WOULD SPIKE OUT 
SI1638	WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO TELL ME A CLOTHESHORSE WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA 
SI1639	LOVIE YOU MAKE ME FEEL NAKED 
SI1640	HOW DID ONE JOIN THEM 
SI1641	WERE YOU IN LOVE WITH THAT GIRL 
SI1642	YOU'VE NOT SEEMED LIKE THEM BUT MAYBE YOU ARE 
SI1643	NURSES' TRAINING HERE DOESN'T COST ANYTHING 
SI1644	THEY EVEN PAY ME SIX DOLLARS A MONTH 
SI1645	SUCH OPTIMISM WAS COMPLETELY UNJUSTIFIED 
SI1646	YOUR LEG MUSCLES AND BACK MUSCLES FEEL WEARY 
SI1647	IF IT EVER GOT BEHIND ME THE BEEP TURNED TO A BUZZ 
SI1648	IT WAS A FAIRLY MODERN MOTEL WITH QUITE A BIT OF ELECTRICAL DISPLAY IN FRONT 
SI1649	IT'S A FORMALITY YOU KNOW 
SI1650	YOU SEE SHE'S ON A DIET 
SI1651	SHE LOOKED AT ME PROVOCATIVELY 
SI1652	KINDA LIKE A ZOMBIE 
SI1653	HE SPOKE SOOTHINGLY 
SI1654	YOU DON'T HAFTA GET NASTY 
SI1655	SO HE UNDERSTOOD HER PANIC 
SI1656	SHE BLEW HER NOSE ON A TISSUE AND OPENED THE COKE BOTTLE 
SI1657	OR BORROW SOME MONEY FROM SOMEONE AND GO HOME BY BUS 
SI1658	WHERE WERE THEY NOW 
SI1659	SOMEWHERE BIRDS WERE SWEETLY CALLING WERE ANSWERED 
SI1660	THE CAR DOOR CRASHED SHUT 
SI1661	DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT MIGHT HAVE GONE 
SI1662	DID ANYONE SEE MY CAB 
SI1663	HE THOUGHT HE SAW A PALE FACE AT A WINDOW 
SI1664	THERE WERE OTHER FARMHOUSES NEARBY 
SI1665	A FOOLISH THOUGHT CAME INTO HIS HEAD 
SI1666	HE REMEMBERED A STORY HE HAD READ AS A YOUTH 
SI1667	HE HELD HIS ARMS CLOSE TO HIS SIDES AND MADE HIMSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE 
SI1668	OH NO NOT AGAIN HE SAID ALOUD 
SI1669	BE EXCITED AND DON'T IDENTIFY YOURSELF 
SI1670	GOT NO BUSINESS OVER HERE ON A STAKE-OUT ANYWAY 
SI1671	THE KNIFELIKE PAIN IN HIS GROIN NEARLY BROUGHT HIM DOWN AGAIN 
SI1672	IT MOVED IN A SILVER ARC TOWARD HIS THROAT THEN VEERED DOWNWARD 
SI1673	ONE THING HE THOUGHT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT YET 
SI1674	HE PUT IT IN HIS OWN POCKET FOR SAFEKEEPING 
SI1675	THE BODY WAS HEAVIER THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED 
SI1676	IT SNOWED CONTINUOUSLY BUT QUIETLY EVENLY 
SI1677	THE SOFT SNOW WAS DECEITFUL UNDERFOOT 
SI1678	TWICE HE NEARLY FELL 
SI1679	DEEP ENOUGH HE DECIDED 
SI1680	HE CHECKED INTO A MOTEL AND DROVE DOWNTOWN 
SI1681	THE SHERIFF'S SWIVEL CHAIR TILTED BACK 
SI1682	SHE'D ALSO REMEMBER IF THE GROOM DIED LATER 
SI1683	HAVE THEY INHERITED SOME MONEY OR SOMETHING 
SI1684	SHE ASKED WITH A REPORTORIAL GLEAM IN HER EYE 
SI1685	COME ON LET'S HURRY DOWN BEFORE THEY LOCK UP FOR THE DAY 
SI1686	IT LATCHES WHEN YOU CLOSE IT SO STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE 
SI1687	NOW DON'T SHUT THIS DOOR 
SI1688	SOMETHING ELSE DISTRACTED HIM YET THERE WAS NO SOUND ONLY TOMBLIKE SILENCE 
SI1689	THEN HE HEARD THE OUTER DOOR CLOSING 
SI1690	HEY COME BACK HE SHOUTED 
SI1691	NO THEY COULD KILL HIM JUST AS EASY RIGHT NOW 
SI1692	EXCEPT FOR THOSE MINUTES IN HER ROOM HE HAD LOST TOUCH WITH HER AS A REALITY 
SI1693	IT WAS AWKWARD: VERY AWKWARD 
SI1694	SOMEONE REASONABLY TRUSTWORTHY 
SI1695	ANYTHING TO DO WITH AN ACE O' SPADES BAD LUCK 
SI1696	NOT WHEN SHE'D WAITED SO LONG ALREADY 
SI1697	IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO IDENTIFY AS OPIUM BY ITS ODOR 
SI1698	SO SOMEBODY ELSE KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO HER FATHER'S MONEY IF SHE DIED 
SI1699	WELL THEN WHO BROUGHT IT 
SI1700	TAKE YOUR COBBLER'S SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE 
SI1701	EMOTIONALLY THEY PENETRATED HIM NOT AT ALL 
SI1702	AND SO HE WALKED AIMLESS AGAIN 
SI1703	WHEN HE LEFT SHE KNEW SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN 
SI1704	YOU'RE A TAXPAYER HOUSEHOLDER LANDLORD 
SI1705	GOT THE UPSTAIRS GUY HE BELLOWS 
SI1706	THEY'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S COOKING 
SI1707	FOR A MAN OF HIS MASS HE WAS CURIOUSLY SHORT 
SI1708	ME HE SAID MERRILY 
SI1709	THOSE LOVELY WHORLS HE CHORTLED 
SI1710	THEY HAD COME NOT TO ADMIRE BUT TO OBSERVE 
SI1711	THEY'RE GOING TO LOUSE ME UP GOOD 
SI1712	YOU THINK SOMEBODY IS GOING TO STAND UP IN THE AUDIENCE AND MAKE GUILTY FACES 
SI1713	HE MAY TRY TO PHONE US 
SI1714	HERE'S WHERE LUCK WOULD NORMALLY STEP IN 
SI1715	WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK WHAT FOLLOWED WAS STRAINED EVEN MACABRE 
SI1716	HE DREW A DEEP BREATH 
SI1717	LULLABY AND GOODNIGHT HIS VOICE SHOOK 
SI1718	DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY THINK OF ME 
SI1719	WE'VE DONE OUR PART 
SI1720	THEY TOOK IT AWAY OVERALLS OR SOMETHING 
SI1721	COME HOME RIGHT AWAY 
SI1722	HE DROVE AND THE ROAD WOBBLED FAMILIAR SCENES CREPT PAST ON EITHER SIDE 
SI1723	A NEW IDEA DRIFTED IN FROM NOWHERE 
SI1724	THEY WERE ALL FADED 
SI1725	WORN THROUGH AT THE KNEES 
SI1726	AND MEN ALSO USED VACUUM CLEANERS IN BOTH ROOMS SUCKING DUST UP ONCE MORE 
SI1727	CHECK THE OVERNIGHTERS OUT 
SI1728	ANYBODY CARRYING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HIDE A RIFLE 
SI1729	SHRUGS MET THAT FROM ROOM CLERKS FROM BELLHOPS 
SI1730	NOBODY IN HIS RIGHT MIND PUNISHES A QUARTER-CENTURY-OLD DERELICTION 
SI1731	JEOPARDIZE IT NOW TO CORRECT SO OLD A WRONG 
SI1732	BITTER UNREASONING JEALOUSY 
SI1733	HE ALSO REMINDED HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES 
SI1734	IT WAS NOT WHATEVER TALE WAS TOLD BY TAILS 
SI1735	AND POSSESSED HIMSELF HOW 
SI1736	THE POOR UNLUCKY THE TELEPHONE RANG 
SI1737	BRAIN EXAMINED FOR THROMBOSIS CLOT OR HEMORRHAGE 
SI1738	NO SIGNS OF THESE NO GROSS HEMORRHAGE OF LUNGS HEART BRAIN OR STOMACH 
SI1739	OH THE TIME OF DEATH 
SI1740	PROBABLY AROUND MIDNIGHT GIVE OR TAKE AN HOUR EITHER WAY 
SI1741	SHE ALWAYS DID BEFORE AND SHOWED THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN WHATEVER WE ADVISED 
SI1742	WITH HER SHARP TONGUE SHE'D HAVE CUT HIS POMPOUSNESS TO RIBBONS 
SI1743	HE WENT ON TO PERSONAL BEQUESTS A LIST OF NAMES LARGELY UNKNOWN TO HIM 
SI1744	OLD PEOPLE HAVE THEIR IDIOSYNCRASIES 
SI1745	THIS ONE CAME A BIT HIGH AT THIRTY THOUSAND OR MORE 
SI1746	HIS SALARY HAD REACHED THE TEN THOUSAND MARK 
SI1747	HE WOULD OFFER NO THEORY TO ACCOUNT FOR HER MURDER 
SI1748	IT'S STILL UNBELIEVABLE THAT IT WAS MURDER 
SI1749	NEVERTHELESS IT'S TRUE 
SI1750	COULD THE AMBASSADOR HIMSELF BE THE MAN ON THIS SIDE THE PRIME MINISTER FEARED 
SI1751	ONE MORE MUDDLEHEADED PLAY LIKE THAT ONE AND THEY'D BE LEADING HIM AWAY 
SI1752	IN THE LIGHTED INTERIOR HE SAW OTHER MEN AND WOMEN STRUGGLING INTO THEIR WRAPS 
SI1753	HE COULD PICK UP ANOTHER PACK ON HIS WAY HOME IF HE WERE GOING HOME 
SI1754	HE SAID: THE CRAZY FOOL HALF ALOUD 
SI1755	ONLY THEN DID HE DECIDE HE DIDN'T WANT ONE 
SI1756	MEANWHILE FISHERMEN TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEM TO PULL UP WHOPPERS 
SI1757	HIS SARCASM WAS FOLLOWED BY A STUPID GRIN OF HIS THICK MOUTH AND BAD TEETH 
SI1758	WIDOW NICE SORT OF WOMAN 
SI1759	GOT A HECK OF A BUY ON THIS DIRT CHEAP 
SI1760	THE WRINKLED MOUTH LAUGHED REVEALING ASTONISHINGLY STRONG WHITE TEETH 
SI1761	HIDING OUT LIKE THIS WON'T GET HIM ANYTHING EXCEPT MORE TROUBLE OR A BULLET 
SI1762	IF SHE MOVED GRACEFULLY SHE WAS CLUMSY AT IT 
SI1763	THAT'S YOUR HEADACHE 
SI1764	SOAK UP LOCAL COLOR 
SI1765	NO OTHER VISITOR INQUIRED FOR HER THAT EVENING 
SI1766	WE HAVE BETTER ROOMS VACANT NOW HE BABBLED 
SI1767	TWO WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN CHATTERING LIKE PARROTS WERE STRUCK DUMB 
SI1768	THE CLERK'S EYES FLICKERED 
SI1769	SUPPOSE YOU TELL ME THE REAL REASON HE DRAWLED 
SI1770	THERE IS NO STORY HE PIPED TREMULOUSLY 
SI1771	A THICK CRIMSON CARPET MUFFLED EVERY FOOTFALL 
SI1772	HASTILY THE BOY SWITCHED ON A CEILING LIGHT 
SI1773	THE ROOM LOOKED NORMAL AND EVEN COMMONPLACE 
SI1774	THERE WAS NO HINT OF A VIOLENT STRUGGLE NOW 
SI1775	THE BLUE RUG WAS SUSPICIOUSLY BRIGHT AND NEW 
SI1776	AFRAID YOU'LL LOSE YOUR JOB IF YOU DON'T KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT 
SI1777	WERE YOU ON DUTY HERE TWO WEEKS AGO 
SI1778	WOMEN DIDN'T USE WHITE FACE POWDER NOWADAYS HE RECALLED 
SI1779	THEY USED PINK TAN OR CREAM POWDER 
SI1780	A MONSTROUS SHADOW FELL ACROSS THE ILLUMINATED WALL DISTORTED AND INDEFINABLE 
SI1781	THE SHADOW VANISHED 
SI1782	THERE WAS A THICK SQUASHY CRACK OF FIST ON FLESH 
SI1783	ROUGH CLOTH RASPED HIS FIST 
SI1784	THERE WAS A GRUNT CURIOUSLY INARTICULATE LIKE THAT OF AN ANIMAL IN PAIN 
SI1785	ON THE BARE FLOORBOARDS A MAN LAY FACE DOWN 
SI1786	THE MAN'S EYELIDS FLUTTERED 
SI1787	IT'S PERHAPS A MILE FROM HERE WHERE WE SIT 
SI1788	PRETTY GIRLS AMONG THEM WITH BLONDE HAIR AND PERT FACES 
SI1789	LIKE HIS GLOSSY BLACK HAIR 
SI1790	OH YES HE'D TALKED ABOUT DOING SO 
SI1791	NO THE MAN WAS NOT DRUNK HE WONDERED HOW HE GOT TIED UP WITH THIS STRANGER 
SI1792	WHY DON'T THEY TELL ME THEMSELVES IF IT BOTHERS THEM 
SI1793	THIS FAVORITE GRIEVANCE WAS NOT THE LANDLORD 
SI1794	BUT WHY PAY HER BILLS 
SI1795	HE SHRUGGED CASUALLY 
SI1796	HIS EYES BURNED FEVERISHLY 
SI1797	C'MON HE WHISPERED FLOOR LEVEL'S ABOUT THREE FEET DOWN SO DON'T FALL 
SI1798	WE'LL BOTH BE BLOWING TOWN TOMORROW SO WE WON'T BE MOVING IN ON YOU 
SI1799	HIS SURE-SURE WAS ENTHUSIASTIC THIS TIME 
SI1800	TO KAYO HIM AND MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT KILL 
SI1801	IF WE LEFT ONE WE'D HAVE TO WIPE IT FOR FINGERPRINTS 
SI1802	OUR HYPOTHETICAL OTHER BUM WHO KILLED HIM WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT HIS POCKETS 
SI1803	IN FACT NOBODY SAW US COP OR CITIZEN 
SI1804	IT HAD GONE LIKE CLOCKWORK 
SI1805	HOW SAFE IS TOO SAFE 
SI1806	SHALL WE FLIP A COIN TO SEE WHICH OF US GOES FIRST 
SI1807	SELF'S INTEGRITY WAS AND IS AND EVER HAD BEEN 
SI1808	THEY WENT DOWNSTAIRS LOADED A TRAY LAVISHLY 
SI1809	OKAY TAKE THE TRAY 
SI1810	THAT'LL BE PLENTY TO EAT BY 
SI1811	PRESENTLY HIS WATER BROTHER SAID BREATHLESSLY 
SI1812	ETERNITY IS NO TIME FOR RECRIMINATIONS 
SI1813	YOU TOO WERE A STUPID JACKASS UNTIL YOU POISONED ME 
SI1814	AFTERWARDS YOU DID WELL ENOUGH 
SI1815	MIKE WAS OF LEGAL AGE AND PRESUMED ABLE TO DEFEND HIMSELF IN THE CLINCHES 
SI1816	ANYHOW IT WAS HIGH TIME THE BOY WAS SALTED 
SI1817	MY BELOVED WARD MY PERENNIAL GADFLY SAID THE WHINING VOICE 
SI1818	FUMING HELPLESS HE WATCHED THEM PASS HIM 
SI1819	HE RUBBED HIS EYES SLEEPILY WITH ONE HUGE PAW 
SI1820	A RANGE OF BLUFFS HUGGED THE HORIZON THE COLOR OF DECAYING MOSS 
SI1821	THESE PLANETS WERE MUCH BIGGER NEARLY ALL CAPABLE OF HOLDING AN ATMOSPHERE 
SI1822	BUT TO THE INFURIATION OF SCIENTISTS FOR NO KNOWN REASON NOT ALL OF THEM DID 
SI1823	SONIC ELECTRONIC GALVANIC ALL BLANK 
SI1824	POSITIVE RESULTS START WHEN IT GOES TOWARDS THE HAND YOU USE TO MAKE YOUR MARK 
SI1825	HE WASN'T LIKELY TO COME DOWN WITH HOT CHILLS AND PUZZLING STRIPED FEVER 
SI1826	IT LOOKS LIKE WE DID WHEN WE MADE BLASTDOWN 
SI1827	MAYBE IT WOULD WORK THE OTHER WAY 
SI1828	ACTUALLY THEY SAID HE DID SLEEP BUT SO SHORTLY AND FITFULLY THAT HE FORGOT 
SI1829	HIS BODY PROCESSES ONLY SLOWED DOWN ENOUGH FOR HIM TO DISPEL FATIGUE POISONS 
SI1830	THE BUDDIES INVARIABLY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HIM 
SI1831	BEHIND HIM HIS MATES STIRRED WITHOUT WAKING 
SI1832	YOU ARE RIGHT NOW BUDDY 
SI1833	WHY PICK ME FOR YOUR PATSY 
SI1834	WHY ACCUSE A SHIPMATE OF BEING BEHIND THIS 
SI1835	THE TAPES SHOW THAT 
SI1836	THERE'S STILL SUCH A THING AS MENTAL ILLNESS 
SI1837	HER HUM BECAME A GURGLE OF SURPRISE 
SI1838	THE LADY'S EYES UNMAGNIFIED BUGGED OUT 
SI1839	YOU PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ADJUSTABLE VISION 
SI1840	THE GOOD MAN CHORTLED APPRECIATIVELY AND DECIDED THE TRIP WAS WORTH HIS TIME 
SI1841	SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO SING ANY ROLE AND ANY SONG WHICH STRUCK HER FANCY 
SI1842	WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE WAS THE SHIP 
SI1843	SHE WAS READY FOR HER GREAT ADVENTURES AND THE ARRIVAL OF HER MOBILE PARTNER 
SI1844	HELLO ANYONE AT HOME 
SI1845	THE SUDDEN SOLITUDE HAD LOST ITS MOMENTARY CHARM AND BECOME OPPRESSIVE 
SI1846	THE MANY-BODIED GIRL LAY NEAR HIM 
SI1847	SHE RADIATED WARMTH AND GOOD FELLOWSHIP 
SI1848	WE CAN DIE TOO WE CAN DIE LIKE REAL PEOPLE 
SI1849	HE REMEMBERED THEM WELL FROM HIS HAPPY PERIOD 
SI1850	A GOOD MORROW TO YOU MY BOY 
SI1851	YOU MEAN A GAME WITH CARDS 
SI1852	SOON SAID THE HALF-MAN 
SI1853	THUS EVENTS OCCURRED AND VICTIMS CHANGED IN APPEARANCE AND NEW ONES ARRIVED 
SI1854	HE REMEMBERED THE LAST TIME HE HAD EATEN ACTUAL EGGS FROM AN ACTUAL PAN 
SI1855	PEOPLE NEVER LIVE FOREVER 
SI1856	HER EYES WERE GLAZED AS IF SHE DIDN'T HEAR OR EVEN SEE HIM 
SI1857	NO GIRL WOULD GO THIS FAR TO FOOL A MAN SO SHE COULD KILL HIM 
SI1858	SHE DRANK GREEDILY AND MURMURED THANK YOU AS HE LOWERED HER HEAD 
SI1859	WE'LL WORK FOR OUR KEEP THE BOY SAID EAGERLY 
SI1860	WE'RE NOT DRUNKARDS SHE SAID

SI1863	WE HAVEN'T SLEPT TOGETHER SINCE WE STARTED 
SI1864	YOU DON'T HATE ME ANY MORE 
SI1865	NOW THERE'S NOTHIN LEFT OF ME 
SI1866	THIRTY-FIVE THEY RODE AT A MEASURED PACE THROUGH THE VALLEY 
SI1867	THEN AT LAST THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO DISSOLVE 
SI1868	THEY NEITHER GAINED NOR FELL BACK 
SI1869	HE RODE LOW ON THE MARE'S NECK 
SI1870	A BAYONET HUNG IN A BELT SCABBARD 
SI1871	THE GUERRILLA BIVOUAC REMAINED SILENT 
SI1872	HE KISSED HER ALSO AND WITH DEEP TENDERNESS 
SI1873	RUNNING AROUND IN THE MOONLIGHT ALMOST NAKED AND SLUGGING A MAN WITH A ROCK 
SI1874	HE MIGHT SAY OR DO SOMETHING FOOLISH 
SI1875	THEY WERE TETHERED ARMY STYLE ON STABLE LINES 
SI1876	A VOICE SPOKE NEAR-AT-HAND 
SI1877	THERE'S NO CHANCE NOW OF ALL OF US GETTING AWAY 
SI1878	YOU'LL HAVE TO TRY IT ALONE 
SI1879	THAT TOUCHED OFF A TOTAL STAMPEDE 
SI1880	HE PICKED UP THE POWDER CANISTER AND RAN OUT 
SI1881	POWDER FLAME GUSHED BENEATH THE WAGON 
SI1882	GUERRILLAS WERE RACING TOWARD HIM 
SI1883	SOME TORE ENTIRELY THROUGH THE WHIPSAWED POST OAK 
SI1884	THE WAGONS WERE BURNING FIERCELY 
SI1885	THE MUDWAGON HAD CAUGHT FIRE ALSO 
SI1886	THE ROOF OF THE COMMAND POST BEGAN TO BUCKLE 
SI1887	ANYTHING WRONG CAP'N 
SI1888	THERE'S NO WAR ON NOW 
SI1889	HIS LEGS PUMPED FURIOUSLY HIS LONG BLACK HAIR STREAMED OUT BEHIND HIM 
SI1890	ALTHOUGH MY SHOT KILLED HIS HORSE HE ROLLED OFF THE BALE ON TOP OF ME 
SI1891	HIS EYES WERE DARK FLUID FEARFUL AND HE GAVE A SIGH AS MY KNIFE WENT IN 
SI1892	YOU COULD BURN DOWN THIS WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WITH A FIRE THAT SIZE 
SI1893	IT TOOK HIM A LONG TIME TO COMPOSE HIMSELF 
SI1894	MY FATHER RAN HIM OFF HERE SIX YEARS AGO 
SI1895	IT MIGHT HURT YOU THOUGH 
SI1896	AND HE WAS HANDSOME DESPITE THE LONG THIN SCAR THAT SLANTED ACROSS HIS CHEEK 
SI1897	SHE SEEMED IRRITATED 
SI1898	YOU'VE GOT NO BUSINESS UP HERE 
SI1899	YOU TOOK ME BY SURPRISE 
SI1900	THERE WOULD STILL BE PLENTY OF MOMENTS OF REGRET AND SADNESS AND GUILTY RELIEF 
SI1901	A WARM BREEZE PLAYED ACROSS IT MOVING IT LIKE WAVES 
SI1902	THE PULSING GLOW OF A CIGARETTE 
SI1903	WHEN HE SAW ME COMING HE TURNED HIS RADIO OFF 
SI1904	WHEN SUITABLY LIGHTED WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE 
SI1905	MEANWHILE SPRING HAD PASSED WELL INTO SUMMER 
SI1906	THEY HAD CHOSEN THIS NIGHT PURPOSELY 
SI1907	BURY THOSE UNIFORMS SO THEY WON'T BE FOUND 
SI1908	AFTER ANOTHER LONG PAUSE HE ASKED HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE 
SI1909	FAT SHOWED IN LOOSE ROLLS BENEATH THE SHIRT 
SI1910	HE LIVED AND BREATHED FOR THE MINING COMPANY 
SI1911	TEN YEARS AGO THEY BLEW UP SOME OF OUR DITCHES 
SI1912	IT COST US A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY DAYS LOST TIME TO FIX THEM 
SI1913	THE GUNMAN NODDED SLIPPING THE PICTURE INTO HIS BREAST POCKET SAYING NOTHING 
SI1914	AS SHE DROVE SHE THOUGHT ABOUT HER PLAN 
SI1915	IT WAS THERE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO ENACT HER RENUNCIATION BEG FORGIVENESS 
SI1916	PERHAPS IT WAS ALL A VIVIDLY CONCEIVED DREAM 
SI1917	NEVERTHELESS SHE CONTINUED TO MOVE UPWARD 
SI1918	IT CIRCLED HER THIGHS EXPLORING WITH ITS ICY TENTACLES 
SI1919	EVERY MOVEMENT SHE MADE SEEMED UNNECESSARILY NOISY 
SI1920	LIPS PURSED MOURNFULLY HE STARED DOWN AT ITS CRAZILY SAGGING LEFT SIDE 
SI1921	AND HIS RELATIVELY SMALL HANDS AND FEET GAVE HIM AN ALMOST DELICATE APPEARANCE 
SI1922	OR MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE A CIGAR 
SI1923	WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT RATTLESNAKE GAG 
SI1924	GETTING THE BOSS RATTLESNAKE TO HELP YOU 
SI1925	SO WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT 
SI1926	WHY SINGLE ME OUT ON THIS PERMIT DEAL 
SI1927	YOU DO THAT OR TAKE YOU OUT A PERMIT RIGHT NOW 
SI1928	NOT IMMEDIATELY AS THE DEPUTY DEMANDED 
SI1929	OIL-FIELD WORKERS WERE A ROUGH-TOUGH LOT 
SI1930	A RABBIT PUNCH REDOUBLED HIM 
SI1931	NO MORE COULD HE DEFEND HIMSELF AGAINST THEM 
SI1932	WHY HE'S GOING TO KILL ME HE THOUGHT WILDLY 
SI1933	BEAT ME TO DEATH IN FRONT OF A HUNDRED PEOPLE 
SI1934	WAIT A LITTLE WHILE 
SI1935	IN MY PLACE YOU'D FOLLOW SUCH ADVICE AS YOU GIVE ME 
SI1936	WE'LL RIDE OUT AS SOON AS WE'VE HAD CHUCK 
SI1937	THEY WERE ALL GOOD MEN 
SI1938	LIGHTED WINDOWS GLOWED JEWEL-BRIGHT THROUGH THE DOWNPOUR 
SI1939	PUT ON HIS OLD BROWN CORDUROY COAT AND IT WAS ALREADY SOAKED 
SI1940	HE WAS ONLY VAGUELY AWARE OF THE SLUICING RAIN 
SI1941	WE'LL TALK OVER AT YOUR OFFICE 
SI1942	IT WAS SECURED BY AN OVERSIZED PADLOCK 
SI1943	FOR THE UNSEEN GHOSTLIKE RIFLEMAN AIMED A LITTLE HIGHER THE THIRD TIME 
SI1944	THE FORMER SCOUT'S ALIBI COULDN'T BE SHAKEN 
SI1945	PRIVATELY HE CREATED AND MAGNIFIED AN IMAGE OF HIMSELF AS A HIRED ASSASSIN 
SI1946	THE RUSTLING PROBLEM WAS BY NO MEANS SOLVED 
SI1947	THERE WERE NO TRACKS OF EITHER HOOFS OR BOOTS 
SI1948	HE MOISTENED HIS LIPS UNEASILY 
SI1949	WHO TOLD YOU TO DO IT 
SI1950	DOES THIS MAKE IT ANY EASIER COWARD 
SI1951	HE WANTED TO SHOW THE TOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO ANYONE WHO TRIED TO START TROUBLE 
SI1952	WE'RE GOING SOMEPLACE 
SI1953	WHERE'RE YOU TAKIN' ME 
SI1954	HONEY HE WHISPERED 
SI1955	LIKE ENOUGH WE'LL ALL BE UP ON TOP BY SUNDOWN 
SI1956	A SINGLE KICK MADE IT SPRING OPEN SHUDDERING 
SI1957	CLAPPING SPURS TO THE BRONC HE SET OFF AT A SHARP CANTER WITH GROWING ALARM 
SI1958	HIS FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE RANCH HOUSE ACROSS THE BRUSHY SWELLS TOLD HIM NOTHING 
SI1959	HE HAD NOT COVERED A HUNDRED YARDS BEFORE A GUN CRASHED FROM SOMEWHERE BEHIND 
SI1960	A SLUG HAD TORN HALF OF HIS STIRRUP-GUARD AWAY 
SI1961	A SECOND TWITCHED HIS SHIRTSLEEVE AND HE FELT A BRIEF BURN ON HIS UPPER ARM 
SI1962	ANOTHER SNARLED CLOSE OVERHEAD 
SI1963	EACH PLANE CARRIED TWO FIVE-HUNDRED POUND BOMBS 
SI1964	THE PILOTS' HEADS LOOKED RIDICULOUSLY SMALL 
SI1965	IF THE OTHER PILOTS WERE WORRIED THEY DID NOT SHOW IT 
SI1966	ALTHOUGH THEY DREW LIGHT GROUND FIRE THEY SAW NO SIGNS OF ACTIVITY 
SI1967	TWELVE O'CLOCK LEVEL 
SI1968	THE OPPOSING AIRCRAFT CONTINUED TO COME ON 
SI1969	IF ANY OF US MISS THEY CAN PICK UP THE PIECES 
SI1970	THE CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE ENEMY CONTINUED ON AS IF NO ONE ELSE WERE AROUND 
SI1971	LET'S TAKE 'EM HOME 
SI1972	PERFECT HE THOUGHT 
SI1973	THE ENEMY DID NOT VEER 
SI1974	AS IF DRAWN BY A WIRE THE ENEMY FLEW INTO THEM 
SI1975	A LARGE PIECE OF ENGINE COWLING VANISHED 
SI1976	WINGMAN STAY CLEAR HE PRAYED 
SI1977	HE FOUGHT THE PANIC OF VERTIGO 
SI1978	SOMETHING PULLED MY LEG 
SI1979	WE WERE OFF THE ROAD GLEAMING BARBED WIRE PULLING TAUT 
SI1980	HIGH SO IT WOULD ONLY BOUNCE HARMLESSLY BUT LOUDLY OFF THE CAR'S STEEL ROOF 
SI1981	ON UNOCCUPIED ROADWAY THE BOTTLE SHATTERED INTO A SMALL AMBER FLASH 
SI1982	TWO CARS CAME OVER A CREST THEIR CHROME AND GLASS FLASHING 
SI1983	BRAKES SHRIEKED BEHIND US 
SI1984	AND WHAT EYES THEY WERE 
SI1985	EYES LIKE HOT HONEY EYES THAT SIZZLED 
SI1986	WHAT'S YOUR NAME ANYWAY

SI1990	HOW WILL WE WORK IT OUT 
SI1991	A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL ROAM THE STREETS IN COSTUMES AND MASKS AND HAVING A BALL 
SI1992	OR MORE RHYTHMICALLY THE SWARTHY WITCHES ARE LAUGHING 
SI1993	SHOULD SHE WAKE HIM 
SI1994	SO IF ALL THESE BEERS WAS TO GET ME IN BED MAN YOU JUST SPENT A LOT OF MONEY 
SI1995	HE BLEW HIS NOSE EXPERTLY BETWEEN HIS FINGERS 
SI1996	YOU SHALL SEE HER AT DINNER 
SI1997	LIKE AS IF IT WERE BUILT OF BOOKS 
SI1998	SHE TOOK IT GRUDGINGLY HER DARK EYES BALEFUL AS THEY MET HIS 
SI1999	SHE ASKED SMOLDERINGLY 
SI2000	WE CAN GET IT IF WE DIG HE SAID PATIENTLY 
SI2001	WE'RE LOST AND BURNING UP ALREADY SHE BIT OUT TENSELY 
SI2002	THEY'LL ROLL OFF IN ANOTHER DAY 
SI2003	IN A WAY HE COULDN'T BLAME HER 
SI2004	SHE HAD JUMPED AWAY FROM HIS SHY TOUCH LIKE A CAT CONFRONTED BY A SIDEWINDER 
SI2005	HE HAD LEFT HER INVIOLATE THINKING FAMILIARITY WOULD GENTLE HER IN TIME 
SI2006	HIS BLUE EYES SOUGHT THE SHIMMERING SEA OF HAZE AHEAD 
SI2007	TO HIS PUZZLEMENT THERE SUDDENLY WAS NO HAZE 
SI2008	HE SWUNG UP OVER THE WHEEL 
SI2009	THE CLOUDS BULGED DOWNWARD AND BURST SUDDENLY INTO A GREAT BLACK FUNNEL 
SI2010	THE CLOUDBURST CUT OFF ABRUPTLY 
SI2011	AT LEAST THE WHEELS DUG IN 
SI2012	HIS WIFE DIDN'T GIVE A SIGN SHE'D HEARD 
SI2013	THEY WERE ALREADY SWOLLEN TO BURSTING 
SI2014	SULPHUR OIL AND COPRA MAKE THE KIND OF TINDER ANY FIREBUG DREAMS OF 
SI2015	THE LIFEBOATS WERE STUCK FAST 
SI2016	HEAVE ON THOSE ROPES THE BOAT'S COME UNSTUCK 
SI2017	LET'S HOPE WE COME TO A SAFER PLACE 
SI2018	THEY WERE SHATTERED 
SI2019	LATER YOU SHALL KNOW IT BETTER 
SI2020	THE OLD WOMAN AROSE STIFFLY AND LED ME TO A CLEARING WHERE A SMALL HUT STOOD 
SI2021	THEN HE WOULD REALIZE THEY WERE REALLY THINGS THAT ONLY HE HIMSELF COULD THINK 
SI2022	WHAT OUTFIT DOES SHE DRIVE FOR 
SI2023	NOWADAYS WE TALK AS THOUGH THE BLITZ WERE JUST A SHORT SKIRMISH 
SI2024	THEY DON'T GO FOR BULL-LIKE MUSCLE AS A RULE 
SI2025	HE DIDN'T TELL HER THE TRUTH HE NOW FREELY ADMITTED TO HIMSELF 
SI2026	THE GREAT BLACK LEOPARDS 
SI2027	THEY CAME UPON CHEETAL DEER AT WOODLAND POOLS 
SI2028	HE TOOK HIS MASK FROM HIS FOREHEAD AND THREW IT UNEXPECTEDLY ACROSS THE DECK 
SI2029	A NOTE OF AWE CAME INTO HIS VOICE 
SI2030	OUR BOY DIDN'T CHICKEN OUT NO SIR 
SI2031	WHATEVER YOU TELL HIM HE WILL DIVE 
SI2032	HE TOOK A BIG SWIG OF HIS DRINK 
SI2033	IT WOULD BE A COLOSSAL SHAME TO THROW AWAY A STORY LIKE THIS 
SI2034	MAKE IT COME OFF ALL RIGHT 
SI2035	HE FELT A GOOD DEAL LESS SHAKY 
SI2036	AS HIS FEET SLOWED HE FELT ASHAMED OF THE PANIC AND RESOLVED TO MAKE A STAND 
SI2037	HE CROSSED THE NEXT MEADOW AND CLIMBED A TREE WHERE THE JUNGLE TRAIL RESUMED 
SI2038	HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF WITH FIRMNESS: NO SURRENDER 
SI2039	HIS SUPERIORS HAD ALSO PREACHED THIS SAYING IT WAS THE WAY FOR ETERNAL HONOR 
SI2040	HIS COMRADES WERE ALL DEAD 
SI2041	THE SHOT REVERBERATED IN DIMINISHING WHIPLASHES OF SOUND 
SI2042	YOU CAME WELL EQUIPPED TO DIE 
SI2043	ARE YOU A THROWER OF FLAME MARINE 
SI2044	WET ALSO WERE THE MARINE'S FATIGUES AND THE FACE HAD AN OILY FILM 
SI2045	BEFORE MUCH LONGER THE MARINE QUIETED DOWN 
SI2046	HE STRAIGHTENED UP ALERT NOW AS THE BUFFALO HUNTER CAME CLOSER 
SI2047	STAY RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU ARE KID HE CALLED 
SI2048	THE KID HAS NO MANNERS BOYS 
SI2049	SHALL WE TEACH HIM SOME 
SI2050	A THIRD SHOT DOUSED THE LIGHT 
SI2051	HE'LL SHOOT UP THE TOWN 
SI2052	THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE STREET COULD BE RAKED WITH RIFLE FIRE FROM THIS BARN 
SI2053	HE SIZED UP THE SITUATION AND SHOOK HIS HEAD 
SI2054	HE SLIPPED OUTSIDE HUGGING THE WALLS OF BUILDINGS AND DODGING INTO DOORWAYS 
SI2055	CAN'T SEEM TO LOCATE LANDMARKS IN THIS SNOW 
SI2056	ALL THAT TIME RIFLE BARRELS WERE POINTING UNWAVERINGLY AT HIS HEAD AND BODY 
SI2057	HE STROLLED BACK TO THE DOOR WHISTLING SOFTLY HANDS STILL CLASPED BEHIND HIM 
SI2058	WHY AIN'T YOU PLAYIN' BALL 
SI2059	THEY PLAYED CRACK THE WHIP A FEW MINUTES WITHOUT MISHAP 
SI2060	THANK YOU SHE SAID DUSTING HERSELF OFF 
SI2061	MAYBE SOME OTHER DAY 
SI2062	OH SHUCKS THE GIRL SAID 
SI2063	TO HIS SURPRISE HIS PLAN WORKED PERFECTLY 
SI2064	HE WAS GIFTED WITH ANIMAL MAGNETISM AND A POTENT ALLURE FOR WOMEN OF ANY RACE 
SI2065	LIFTING HER SKIRTS SHE CLIMBED IN NEVER RELINQUISHING HER GRIP ON HIS ARM 
SI2066	HE SAW A PINT-SIZED MAN WITH A GRAYING SPADE BEARD AND AN UNUSUALLY LARGE HEAD 
SI2067	YEAH SEEMS SO DON'T IT THE BOY LAUGHED HUGGING HER CLOSE 
SI2068	WE DON'T KNOW THIS GUY 
SI2069	HIS HEAD CAME UP AND HE SAID IT DEFIANTLY 
SI2070	COME SIT HE REPEATED MOTIONING TO THE PILED HAY BAGS OVER THE PIG LEAVINGS 
SI2071	YEAH BUT WHAT'RE WE GONNA EAT 
SI2072	HE REACHED ONCE MORE INTO THE CARPET BAG AND BROUGHT UP A PACKAGE OF WIENERS 
SI2073	HE RIPPED DOWN THE CELLOPHANE CAREFULLY AND LAID THREE DOGS ON THE TIN FOIL 
SI2074	HOW COME YOU'RE RIDING THE RODS KIDS LIKE YOU 
SI2075	NOW FORGET ALL THIS OTHER 
SI2076	YOU GONNA GIVE ME A DRINK FELLA 
SI2077	MAYBE YOU AND ME WILL GIRLIE BUT THESE TWO AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE 
SI2078	OR THE BAY OF FEMALE DOGS IN HEAT 
SI2079	THEY HAD SLAPPED THEIR THIGHS 
SI2080	HE WOULD NOT CARRY A BRIEF CASE 
SI2081	ALL THE WHILE SHE SAT THERE HER SINEWY ARMS SWIRLED BEFORE HER CHEST 
SI2082	YOU'RE BOILING MILK AIN'T YOU 
SI2083	ABOVE HIM SLID THE EVASIVE SHADOW OF A STORM CLOUD 
SI2084	WHAT ABOUT A TEA ROOM THEN 
SI2085	SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL SO VALIANT SO PITIABLE 
SI2086	ABSOLUTION FOR HIS LIE 
SI2087	WHY LACERATE THE CONGREGATION 
SI2088	HE'D HAD NO IDEA HOW UNHAPPY HIS SWEET PEACH HAD BEEN 
SI2089	IF HE EVER DID SUCH A THING AGAIN SHE'D DIE OF SHAME 
SI2090	HE SWUNG IN THROUGH HIS OWN WIDE GATEWAY 
SI2091	NO TEMPTATION NO VIRTUE 
SI2092	GO CHANGE YOUR SHOES BEFORE YOU TURN AROUND 
SI2093	HE THEN OFFERED HIS OWN ESTIMATE OF THE WEATHER WHICH WAS UNENTHUSIASTIC 
SI2094	HE SCOWLED AT HER FLOWERS 
SI2095	MY DAD DID IT AND HE LIVED TO A GREAT AGE 
SI2096	RAN AWAY ON A BLACK NIGHT WITH A LAWFUL WEDDED MAN 
SI2097	LEFT MINE MANY A TIME ONLY SHE NEVER KNEW IT 
SI2098	HE GAVE A SHORT HARD LAUGH AND LOOKED AT HER KNOWINGLY 
SI2099	BUT SHE SUFFERED IN HER OFF-DUTY HOURS 
SI2100	THEN AFTER A WHILE SHE WENT TO HER MIRROR 
SI2101	JUST WHY ANYBODY SHOULD WISH TO START A RIOT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER DIDN'T KNOW 
SI2102	HE MAY NOT RISE TO THE HEIGHTS BUT HE CAN GET BY AND EVENTUALLY BE RETIRED 
SI2103	SEE YOU IN ABOUT AN HOUR 
SI2104	AHAH HE THOUGHT A LUSH DIVORCEE AT LAST 
SI2105	IT GAVE HER A LEWD WINKING EFFECT 
SI2106	OUR KEY SALESMEN ARE IN APPLIANCES AND COSMETICS 
SI2107	IT SOUNDED SILLY WHY GO ON 
SI2108	DON'T FORGET WHISKEY IT'S SUCH A BIG SELLER 
SI2109	SHE LOOKED CRESTFALLEN AS IF HE HAD SOMEHOW DISAPPOINTED THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE 
SI2110	WITH ANY LUCK AT ALL HE COULD EASILY FIND A FLOWERPOT 
SI2111	BUT ROULETTE'S NOT MY GAME 
SI2112	HE'S A PINTO AND HE PHOTOGRAPHS WONDERFULLY 
SI2113	HOW'S YOUR LUCK HONEY 
SI2114	STAKE ME SHE SAID AND LET ME AT THOSE DICE 
SI2115	NAMED AFTER THE BALLET 
SI2116	IS THERE ANY WORD YOU WOULD LIKE TO OFFER IN YOUR OWN DEFENSE 
SI2117	HE SAW THE DANGERS NOT THE GLORIES OF BEING IDENTIFIED AS A MUTINEER 
SI2118	THERE IS NOT SPACE TO HOLD OR FORCE TO GUARD ANY INCREASED NUMBER OF PRISONERS 
SI2119	THE INSTINCT OF DISCIPLINE HAS BEEN LOST 
SI2120	HE PAUSED THEN ADDED: EVERYTHING ON A SHIP IS A WEAPON 
SI2121	ANOTHER FIELD HAD GIVEN HIM FAME ENOUGH TO SATISFY ANY EGOTIST 
SI2122	NOW THE HOPE WAS GONE 
SI2123	THIS TRAGIC LAD HAD FORGED HIS OWN SHACKLES 
SI2124	THE AIR SMELLED WARMISH AND FOUL 
SI2125	HIS BLACK HAT WITH ITS WIDE BRIM HIGH CROWN AND FUR TRIM RODE HIGH 
SI2126	ONE WHITE HAND POISED A STICK ABOVE HIS DESK 
SI2127	THE GUTTURAL LANGUAGE FROM THE GHETTO STOPPED 
SI2128	SOME OF THEM IGNORED THE TEXTS AND HAD APPARENTLY MEMORIZED THE WORDS LONG AGO 
SI2129	HIS BODY PITCHED BACK AND FORTH ON THE BENCH 
SI2130	DOES THIS BOTHER YOU 
SI2131	YOU HAD TO BE STUPID OR CRAZY OR IMMORTAL 
SI2132	SHE TOOK IT WITH HER WHEREVER SHE WENT SHE CHOSE IT 
SI2133	HERE THEY DID NOT NEED TO BE IN GHETTOS 
SI2134	ALL HIS FAMILY WAS DEAD EXCEPT FOR HIS SON 
SI2135	YOU FEEL HIM EVERY MILE FURTHER AWAY 
SI2136	EACH OF US HAD HIS OWN SPECIALTY BESIDES 
SI2137	THE EYE IS ALL INWARD OR OUTWARD 
SI2138	WHY SHOULD THIS SUDDENLY ASSAIL HER 
SI2139	THEN THE TELEPHONING BEGAN 
SI2140	WAS IT A HYSTERICAL RELEASE FROM THE LONG STRAIN OF VIGILANCE OF THOSE WEEKS 
SI2141	IT WAS NOBODY'S FAULT 
SI2142	SHE OVERPLAYED HER HAND 
SI2143	WHY PUT SUCH A HIGH VALUE ON BEING TOP DOG 
SI2144	WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO WORRY ME 
SI2145	WAS SHE JUST NATURALLY SLOPPY ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT HER PHYSICAL APPEARANCE 
SI2146	BUT IT WAS A HOPEFUL SIGN HE TOLD HIMSELF 
SI2147	WHEN THEY GOT HOME AT MIDNIGHT SHE WAS TIRED OUT 
SI2148	LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE 
SI2149	LET'S BE FINE SUPERIOR PEOPLE OF GREAT DIGNITY HE SAID AS IF HE WERE JOKING 
SI2150	THEN HE FLED NOT WAITING TO SEE IF SHE MINDED HIM OR TOOK NOTICE OF HIS CRY 
SI2151	HE SANK BACK SIGHING AND WAS SOON ASLEEP AGAIN 
SI2152	HIS FINGERS FUMBLED ACROSS THE BANDAGES 
SI2153	HE RECOGNIZED HIS JACKET AND TROUSERS 
SI2154	SHE MUST HAVE PUT HIS CLOTHES IN THE CLOSET 
SI2155	HE WAS KNEELING TO TIE HIS SHOELACES 
SI2156	HIS FINGERS FELT ABSURDLY THICK AND CLUMSY 
SI2157	WHO WOULD TAKE OVER 
SI2158	FOR A MOMENT HE FELT LIKE A THIEF DISCOVERED 
SI2159	HER FACE SEEMED TO FLOAT IN AN IMPLAUSIBLY BRIGHT SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT 
SI2160	HE HAD NEVER FELT PARTICULARLY CLOSE TO HER 
SI2161	FORGET WE EVER KNEW WHAT 
SI2162	HIS VOICE SEEMED THICK AND PURPOSELESS 
SI2163	ARE YOU POSITIVE YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT BY YOURSELF 
SI2164	TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF THEN 
SI2165	NO REALLY RIGHT AS RAIN 
SI2166	LOOK SWEETHEART SOME FOOL WAS 
SI2167	A SMILE PULLED AT THE LOWER STRIP OF ADHESIVE TAPE 
SI2168	THEY MAKE US CONFORMISTS LOOK GOOD 
SI2169	UPSTAIRS BUSY FEET SHOWERING LIKE RAINDROPS PATTERED AROUND HER ROOM 
SI2170	HIS DARK BROWS WHICH HAD BEEN LOWERED IN ANGER SMOOTHED 
SI2171	HOW LONG WOULD IT BE OCCUPIED 
SI2172	STRENGTH BEGAN TO ZIP UP AND DOWN HIS CHEST 
SI2173	HE WADDED HIS SWEAT SHIRT INTO A BALL AND STRIPPED DOWN TO HIS SWIMMING TRUNKS 
SI2174	AW SHUT UP HE SAID 
SI2175	SHIVERING HE PUT ON HIS CLOTHES 
SI2176	WATCH IT BIG SHOT A HOARSE VOICE YELLED BACK 
SI2177	SHE WAS HOLDING ON TO HIS ROCK WITH ONE HAND 
SI2178	HER COUGH SOUNDED LIKE CLOTH RIPPING 
SI2179	MY MOTHER NEVER WOPS ME 
SI2180	SHE SPOUTED A MOUTHFUL OF WATER INTO THE AIR 
SI2181	PART COLLIE PART WIRE-HAIRED TERRIER 
SI2182	NATURALLY CURLY HAIR RUNS IN MY FAMILY 
SI2183	BOOKS ARE FOR SCHNOOKS 
SI2184	EITHER THAT OR A VETERINARIAN 
SI2185	SHE SAID SHARKS HAVE NO BONES AND SHRIMP SWAM BACKWARD 
SI2186	HER FACE TURNED PINK WITH PLEASURE AND A SMOTHERED COUGH 
SI2187	HE DAYDREAMED ON THE ROCK WHILE SHE SWAM AND SPLASHED AROUND 
SI2188	HE SAYS HE'LL BE HERE ON THE ONE-O'CLOCK PLANE 
SI2189	YOU SAW THEM ALWAYS TOGETHER THOSE YEARS 
SI2190	NOW YOU KNOW SHE COULD'VE BUT SHE ISN'T THAT KIND OF GIRL 
SI2191	SHE DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO REFUSE 
SI2192	BUT NOW SHE LOOKED UGLY 
SI2193	NOW MAYBE THEY'D REALIZE THAT LIFE CAN BE TOUGH 
SI2194	HE HAD FALLEN INTO A SOFT JOB AND NOW THE JOB WAS GONE AND HE WAS STRANDED 
SI2195	VIRUS INFECTION NOTHING SHE'D SCREAM AT HIM 
SI2196	A PROFESSION THAT BROUGHT ME AS GOOD AN INCOME AS MINE WASN'T TO BE SNEEZED AT 
SI2197	THE WARD WAS A SMALL ONE FOUR BEDS KEPT RESERVED FOR FEMALE ALCOHOLICS 
SI2198	BUT IF SHE WASN'T INTERESTED SHE'D JUST GO BACK TO THE SAME LIFE SHE'D LEFT 
SI2199	WILL YOU TELL ME WHY 
SI2200	SHE WENT ON DISREGARDING MY PROTESTS 
SI2201	JUST LET ME DIE IN PEACE 
SI2202	A LONG LONG WAY DOWN 
SI2203	THE REASONS FOR THIS DIVE SEEMED FOOLISH NOW 
SI2204	PRETTY SOON A WOMAN CAME ALONG CARRYING A FOLDED UMBRELLA AS A WALKING STICK 
SI2205	SHE SAW ME AND SAT DOWN BESIDE ME THREE FEET AWAY 
SI2206	NOT GOOD LOOKING BUT SELF-CONFIDENT AND WISE SO THAT IT MADE HER ATTRACTIVE 
SI2207	AS WE ATE WE TALKED 
SI2208	YES BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T RUN OFF TO USE THAT NEW TOOTHBRUSH 
SI2209	A BULLET SHE ANSWERED 
SI2210	NO RETURN ADDRESS WHATSOEVER 
SI2211	HE WAS FULL OF HEAVY FAMILY REMINISCENCE 
SI2212	THE RIDES WERE TAME ENOUGH MOSTLY WE TALKED 
SI2213	SOMEBODY WITH NO VICES 
SI2214	AND NEVER SHOW MY FACE OR MY TRUCK AROUND HERE AGAIN 
SI2215	IT WAS AS BLISSFUL AND FULFILLING A NIGHT AS ANY BRIDE EVER EXPERIENCED 
SI2216	IT'S NEVER WRONG IF LOVE IS REAL 
SI2217	HE'D NOT ONLY TOLD ME SO HE'D PROVED IT 
SI2218	NO PRICE IS TOO HIGH WHEN TRUE LOVE IS AT STAKE 
SI2219	SHARE BATH MAYBE BUT SHARE REFRIGERATOR 
SI2220	THE RED PILLS ARE A VITAMIN-AND-IRON COMPOUND 
SI2221	THIS IS A SLEEPING CAPSULE 
SI2222	YOU YOUNG MEN GET TO BE MY AGE YOU WON'T TAKE FLU SO LIGHTLY 
SI2223	IN THESE DAMP CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS AN ODDS-ON BET TO DEVELOP PNEUMONIA 
SI2224	FINE DAY AFTER TOMORROW SHE ADDED 
SI2225	RUN-DOWN IRON-POOR

SI2233	WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU COME OUT WHEN YOU SAW THEM GANG UP ON ME 
SI2234	NOBODY ELSE DID EITHER 
SI2235	YOU DON'T BELONG IN PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL 
SI2236	NOW DON'T TELL ME WHAT A GOOD BALL PLAYER YOU ARE

SI2239	THE LEAGUES ARE FULL OF GUYS LIKE THAT 
SI2240	WHY NOT TRY ANOTHER CLUB 
SI2241	HE NEEDS OUTFIELDERS BAD 
SI2242	TWENTY-TWO OR TWENTY-THREE

SI2255	HE SWUNG AROUND EYES TOWARD THE BEDROOM SOME FIFTEEN FEET AWAY 
SI2256	SUPPOSE HE RAN UP THE WHITE FLAG ALTOGETHER 
SI2257	BUT HIS RESOLUTION HARDLY SEEMED TO HELP 
SI2258	YOU WERE IN A HURRY WEREN'T YOU 
SI2259	THE TALE HE THOUGHT WOULD BECOME LESS GAY 
SI2260	HEAVY INDUSTRY SLANTED TOWARD INEXHAUSTIBLE GOVERNMENT COFFERS ATTRACTED HIM 
SI2261	WE'RE HERE TO TRANSACT BUSINESS

SI2279	OFFICIALS MEET ON RUBBISH 
SI2280	MANY SHAPES IN BATHTUBS 
SI2281	SAMPLES: HE WALKED IN UPON HER INVITATION 
SI2282	NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON HAS THE ANATOMICAL BEEN CALLED JOCULAR JOURNALESE 
SI2283	IN NEWS ITEMS A MAN IS LESS OFTEN SHOT IN THE BODY OR HEAD THAN IN THE SUBURBS 
SI2284	A WOMAN MET A FAMOUS AUTHOR AT A LITERARY TEA 
SI2285	THE GIRL NODDED UNDERSTANDINGLY 
SI2286	YES SIR SHE SAID IS THAT DEFINITE 
SI2287	OF COURSE DEAR SHE SAID 
SI2288	ANOTHER BRAND OF INDEFINITE REFERENCE ARISES OUT OF THE USE OF THE DOUBLE VERB
